<p></p>

<p>Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns ...  driven time and again off course, once he had plundered  the hallowed heights of Troy.  Many cities of men he saw and learned their minds,  many pains he suffered, heartsick on the open sea,  fighting to save his life and bring his comrades home.  But he could not save them from disaster, hard as he strove &mdash;  the recklessness of their own ways destroyed them all,  the blind fools, they devoured the cattle of the Sun  and the Sungod blotted out the day of their return.  Launch out on his story. Muse, daughter of Zeus,  start from where you will &mdash; sing for our time too. </p>

<p>By now, </p>

<p>all the survivors, all who avoided headlong death  were safe at home, escaped the wars and waves. </p>

<p></p>

<p>But one man alone ... </p>

<p>his heart set on his wife and his return &mdash; Calypso, </p>

<p>the bewitching nymph, the lustrous goddess, held him back, </p>

<p>deep in her arching caverns, craving him for a husband. </p>

<p>But then, when the wheeling seasons brought the year around, </p>

<p>that year spun out by the gods when he should reach his home, </p>

<p>Ithaca &mdash; though not even there would he be free of trials, </p>

<p>even among his loved ones &mdash; then every god took pity, </p>

<p>all except Poseidon. He raged on, seething against </p>

<p>the great Odysseus till he reached his native land. </p>

<p>But now </p>

<p>Poseidon had gone to visit the Ethiopians worlds away,  Ethiopians off at the farthest limits of mankind,  a people split in two, one part where the Sungod sets  and part where the Sungod rises. There Poseidon went  to receive an offering, bulls and rams by the hundred &mdash;  far away at the feast the Sea-lord sat and took his pleasure.  But the other gods, at home in Olympian Zeus's halls,  met for full assembly there, and among them now  the father of men and gods was first to speak,  sorely troubled, remembering handsome Aegisthus,  the man Agamemnon's son, renowned Orestes, killed.  Recalling Aegisthus, Zeus harangued the immortal powers:  &quot;Ah how shameless &mdash; ^the way these mortals blame the gods.  From us alone, they say, come all their miseries, yes,  but they themselves, with their own reckless ways,  compound their pains beyond their proper share.  Look at Aegisthus now ... </p>

<p>above and beyond Azs share he stole Atrides' wife,  he murdered the warlord coming home from Troy  though he knew it meant his own total ruin.  Far in advance we told him so ourselves,  dispatching the guide, the giant-killer Hermes.  'Don't murder the man,' he said, 'don't court his wife.  Beware, revenge will come from Orestes, Agamemnon's son,  that day he comes of age and longs for his native land.'  So Hermes warned, with all the good will in the world. </p>

<p></p>

<p>but would Aegisthus' hardened heart give way?  Now he pays the price &mdash; all at a single stroke.&quot; </p>

<p>And sparkling-eyed Athena drove the matter home:  &quot;Father, son of Cronus, our high and mighty king,  surely he goes down to a death he earned in full!  Let them all die so, all who do such things.  But my heart breaks for Odysseus,  that seasoned veteran cursed by fate so long &mdash;  far from his loved ones still, he suffers torments  off on a wave-washed island rising at the center of the seas.  A dark wooded island, and there a goddess makes her home,  daughter of Atlas, wicked Titan who sounds the deep  in all its depths, whose shoulders lift on high  the colossal pillars thrusting earth and sky apart.  Atlas' daughter it is who holds Odysseus captive,  luckless man &mdash; despite his tears, forever trying  to spellbind his heart with suave, seductive words  and wipe all thought of Ithaca from his mind.  But he, straining for no more than a glimpse  of hearth-smoke drifting up from his own land,  Odysseus longs to die ... </p>

<p>Olympian Zeus,  have you no care for him 'm your lofty heart?  Did he never win your favor with sacrifices  burned beside the ships on the broad plain of Troy?  Why, Zeus, why so dead set against Odysseus?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;My child,&quot; Zeus who marshals the thunderheads replied,  &quot;what nonsense you let slip through your teeth. Now,  how on earth could 1 forget Odysseus? Great Odysseus  who excels all men in wisdom, excels in offerings too  he gives the immortal gods who rule the vaulting skies?  No, it's the Earth-Shaker, Poseidon, unappeased,  forever fuming against him for the Cyclops  whose giant eye he blinded: godlike Polyphemus,  towering over all the Cyclops' clans in power. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The nymph Thoosa bore him, daughter of Phorcys,  lord of the barren salt sea &mdash; she met Poseidon  once in his vaulted caves and they made love.  And now for his blinded son the earthquake god &mdash;  though he won't quite kill Odysseus &mdash;  drives him far off course from native land.  But come, all of us here put heads together now,  work out his journey home so Odysseus can return.  Lord Poseidon, 1 trust, will let his anger go.  How can he stand his ground against the will  of all the gods at once &mdash; one god alone?&quot; </p>

<p>Athena, her eyes flashing bright, exulted,  &quot;Father, son of Cronus, our high and mighty king!  If now it really pleases the blissful gods  that wise Odysseus shall return &mdash; home at last &mdash;  let us dispatch the guide and giant-killer Hermes  down to Ogygia Island, down to announce at once  to the nymph with lovely braids our fixed decree:  Odysseus journeys home &mdash; ^the exile must return!  While 1 myself go down to Ithaca, rouse his son  to a braver pitch, inspire his heart with courage  to summon the flowing-haired Achaeans to full assembly,  speak his mind to all those suitors, slaughtering on and on  his droves of sheep and shambling longhorn cattle.  Next 1 will send him off to Sparta and sandy Pylos,  there to learn of his dear father's journey home.  Perhaps he will hear some news and make his name  throughout the mortal world. &quot; </p>

<p>So Athena vowed  and under her feet she fastened the supple sandals,  ever-glowing gold, that wing her over the waves  and boundless earth with the rush of gusting winds.  She seized the rugged spear tipped with a bronze point &mdash;  weighted, heavy, the massive shaft she wields to break the lines  of heroes the mighty Father's daughter storms against.  And down she swept from Olympus' craggy peaks  and lit on Ithaca, standing tall at Odysseus' gates. </p>

<p></p>

<p>the threshold of his court. Gripping her bronze spear,  she looked for all the world like a stranger now,  like Mentes, lord of the Taphians.  There she found the swaggering suitors, just then  amusing themselves with rolling dice before the doors,  lounging on hides of oxen they had killed themselves.  While heralds and brisk attendants bustled round them,  some at the mixing-bowls, mulling wine and water,  others wiping the tables down with sopping sponges,  setting them out in place, still other servants  jointed and carved the great sides of meat. </p>

<p>First by far to see her was Prince Telemachus,  sitting among the suitors, heart obsessed with grief.  He could almost see his magnificent father, here ...  in the mind's eye &mdash; if only might drop from the clouds  and drive these suitors all in a rout throughout the halls  and regain his pride of place and rule his own domains!  Daydreaming so as he sat among the suitors,  he glimpsed Athena now  and straight to the porch he went, mortified  that a guest might still be standing at the doors.  Pausing beside her there, he clasped her right hand  and relieving her at once of her long bronze spear,  met her with winged words: &quot;Greetings, stranger!  Here in our house you'll find a royal welcome.  Have supper first, then tell us what you need.&quot; </p>

<p>He led the way and Pallas Athena followed.  Once in the high-roofed hall, he took her lance  and fixed it firm in a burnished rack against  a sturdy pillar, there where row on row of spears,  embattled Odysseus' spears, stood stacked and waiting.  Then he escorted her to a high, elaborate chair of honor,  over it draped a cloth, and here he placed his guest  with a stool to rest her feet. But for himself  he drew up a low reclining chair beside her,  richly painted, clear of the press of suitors. </p>

<p></p>

<p>concerned his guest, offended by their uproar, </p>

<p>might shrink from food in the midst of such a mob. </p>

<p>He hoped, what's more, to ask him about his long-lost father. </p>

<p>A maid brought water soon in a graceful golden pitcher </p>

<p>and over a silver basin tipped it out </p>

<p>so they might rinse their hands, </p>

<p>then pulled a gleaming table to their side. </p>

<p>A staid housekeeper brought on bread to serve them, </p>

<p>appetizers aplenty too, lavish with her bounty. </p>

<p>A carver lifted platters of meat toward them, </p>

<p>meats of every sort, and set beside them golden cups </p>

<p>and time and again a page came round and poured them wine. </p>

<p>But now the suitors trooped in with all their swagger  and took their seats on low and high-backed chairs.  Heralds poured water over their hands for rinsing,  serving maids brought bread heaped high in trays  and the young men brimmed the mixing-bowls with wine.  They reached out for the good things that lay at hand,  and when they 'd put aside desire for food and drink  the suitors set their minds on other pleasures,  song and dancing, all that crowns a feast.  A herald placed an ornate lyre in Phemius' hands,  the bard who always performed among them there;  they forced the man to sing. </p>

<p>A rippling prelude &mdash;  and no sooner had he struck up his rousing song  than Telemachus, head close to Athena's sparkling eyes,  spoke low to his guest so no one else could hear:  &quot;Dear stranger, would you be shocked by what 1 say?  Look at them over there. Not a care in the world,  just lyres and tunes! Easy for them, all right,  they feed on another's goods and go scot-free &mdash;  a man whose white bones lie strewn in the rain somewhere,  rotting away on land or rolling down the ocean's salty swells.  But that man &mdash; if they caught sight of him home in Ithaca,  by god, they 'd all pray to be faster on their feet  than richer in bars of gold and heavy robes. </p>

<p></p>

<p>But now, no use, he's died a wretched death.  No comfort's left for us ... not even if  someone, somewhere, says he's coming home.  The day of his return will never dawn. </p>

<p>Enough. </p>

<p>Tell me about yourself now, clearly, point by point. </p>

<p>Who are you? where are you from? your city? your parents? </p>

<p>What sort of vessel brought you? Why did the sailors </p>

<p>land you here in Ithaca? Who did they say they are? </p>

<p>1 hardly think you came this way on foot! </p>

<p>And tell me this for a fact &mdash; 1 need to know &mdash; </p>

<p>is this your first time here? Or are you a friend of father's, </p>

<p>a guest from the old days? Once, crowds of other men </p>

<p>would come to our house on visits &mdash; visitor that he was, </p>

<p>when he walked among the living.&quot; </p>

<p>Her eyes glinting,  goddess Athena answered, &quot;My whole story, of course,  I'll tell it point by point. Wise old Anchialus  was my father. My own name is Mentes,  lord of the Taphian men who love their oars.  And here I've come, just now, with ship and crew,  sailing the wine-dark sea to foreign ports of call,  to Temese, out for bronze &mdash; our cargo gleaming iron.  Our ship lies moored off farmlands far from town,  riding in Rithron Cove, beneath Mount Nion's woods.  As for the ties between your father and myself,  we've been friends forever, I'm proud to say,  and he would bear me out  if you went and questioned old lord Laertes.  He, 1 gather, no longer ventures into town  but lives a life of hardship, all to himself,  off on his farmstead with an aged serving-woman  who tends him well, who gives him food and drink  when weariness has taken hold of his withered limbs  from hauling himself along his vineyard's steep slopes.  And now I've come &mdash; and why? 1 heard that he was back ...  your father, that is. But no, the gods thwart his passage.  Yet 1 tell you great Odysseus is not dead. He's still alive. </p>

<p></p>

<p>somewhere in this wide world, held captive, out at sea  on a wave-washed island, and hard men, savages,  somehow hold him back against his will. </p>

<p>Wait, </p>

<p>I'll make you a prophecy, one the immortal gods  have planted in my mind &mdash; it will come true, 1 think,  though I'm hardly a seer or know the flights of birds.  He won't be gone long from the native land he loves,  not even if iron shackles bind your father down.  He's plotting a way to journey home at last;  he's never at a loss. </p>

<p>But come, please,  tell me about yourself now, point by point.  You're truly Odysseus' son? You've sprung up so!  Uncanny resemblance ... the head, and the fine eyes &mdash;  1 see him now. How often we used to meet in the old days  before he embarked for Troy, where other Argive captains,  all the best men, sailed in the long curved ships.  From then to this very day  I've not set eyes on Odysseus or he on me. &quot; </p>

<p>And young Telemachus cautiously replied,  &quot;I'll try, my friend, to give you a frank answer.  Mother has always told me I'm his son, it's true,  but 1 am not so certain. Who, on his own,  has ever really known who gave him life?  Would to god I'd been the son of a happy man  whom old age overtook in the midst of his possessions!  Now, think of the most unlucky mortal ever born &mdash;  since you ask me, yes, they say 1 am his son.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Still,&quot; the clear-eyed goddess reassured him,  &quot;trust me, the gods have not marked out your house  for such an unsung future,  not if Penelope has borne a son like you.  But tell me about all this and spare me nothing.  What's this banqueting, this crowd carousing here?  And what part do you play yourself? Some wedding-feast. </p>

<p></p>

<p>some festival? Hardly a potluck supper, 1 would say.  How obscenely they lounge and swagger here, look,  gorging in your house. Why, any man of sense  who chanced among them would be outraged,  seeing such behavior. &quot; </p>

<p>Ready Telemachus  took her up at once: &quot;Well, my friend,  seeing you want to probe and press the question,  once this house was rich, no doubt, beyond reproach  when the man you mentioned still lived here, at home.  Now the gods have reversed our fortunes with a vengeance &mdash;  wiped that man from the earth like no one else before.  1 would never have grieved so much about his death  if he'd gone down with comrades off in Troy  or died in the arms of loved ones,  once he had wound down the long coil of war.  Then all united Achaea would have raised his tomb  and he'd have won his son great fame for years to come.  But now the whirlwinds have ripped him away, no fame for him!  He's lost and gone now &mdash; out of sight, out of mind &mdash; and 1 ...  he's left me tears and grief. Nor do 1 rack my heart  and grieve for him alone. No longer. Now the gods  have invented other miseries to plague me. </p>

<p>Listen. </p>

<p>All the nobles who rule the islands round about,  Dulichion, and Same, and wooded Zacynthus too,  and all who lord it in rocky Ithaca as well &mdash;  down to the last man they court my mother,  they lay waste my house! And mother ...  she neither rejects a marriage she despises  nor can she bear to bring the courting to an end &mdash;  while they continue to bleed my household white.  Soon &mdash; you wait &mdash; ^they'll grind /nedown as well.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Shameful!&quot;&mdash;  brimming with indignation, Pallas Athena broke out.  &quot;Oh how much you need Odysseus, gone so long &mdash;  how (C/lay hands on all these brazen suitors!  If only he would appear, now. </p>

<p></p>

<p>at his house's outer gates and take his stand, </p>

<p>armed with his helmet, shield and pair of spears, </p>

<p>as strong as the man I glimpsed that first time </p>

<p>in our own house, drinking wine and reveling there ... </p>

<p>just come in from Ephyra, visiting Ilus, Mermerus' son. </p>

<p>Odysseus sailed that way, you see, in his swift trim ship, </p>

<p>hunting deadly poison to smear on his arrows' bronze heads. </p>

<p>Ilus refused &mdash; he feared the wrath of the everlasting gods &mdash; </p>

<p>but father, so fond of him, gave him all he wanted. </p>

<p>If only ^Aa^ Odysseus sported with these suitors, </p>

<p>a blood wedding, a quick death would take the lot! </p>

<p>True, but all lies in the lap of the great gods, </p>

<p>whether or not he'll come and pay them back, </p>

<p>here, in his own house. </p>

<p>But you, 1 urge you,  think how to drive these suitors from your halls.  Come now, listen closely. Take my words to heart.  At daybreak summon the island's lords to full assembly,  give your orders to all and call the gods to witness:  tell the suitors to scatter, each to his own place.  As for your mother, if the spirit moves her to marry,  let her go back to her father's house, a man of power.  Her kin will arrange the wedding, provide the gifts,  the array that goes with a daughter dearly loved. </p>

<p>For you, </p>

<p>1 have some good advice, if only you will accept it.  Fit out a ship with twenty oars, the best in sight,  sail in quest of news of your long-lost father.  Someone may tell you something  or you may catch a rumor straight from Zeus,  rumor that carries news to men like nothing else.  First go down to Pylos, question old King Nestor,  then cross over to Sparta, to red-haired Menelaus,  of all the bronze-armored Achaeans the last man back.  Now, if you hear your father's alive and heading home,  hard-pressed as you are, brave out one more year.  If you hear he's dead, no longer among the living,  then back you come to the native land you love. </p>

<p></p>

<p>raise his grave-mound, build his honors high  with the full funeral rites that he deserves &mdash;  and give your mother to another husband. </p>

<p>Then, </p>

<p>once you've sealed those matters, seen them through, </p>

<p>think hard, reach down deep in your heart and soul </p>

<p>for a way to kill these suitors in your house, </p>

<p>by stealth or in open combat. </p>

<p>You must not cling to your boyhood any longer &mdash; </p>

<p>it's time you were a man. Haven't you heard </p>

<p>what glory Prince Orestes won throughout the world </p>

<p>when he killed that cunning, murderous Aegisthus, </p>

<p>who'd killed his famous father? </p>

<p>And you, my friend &mdash;  how tall and handsome 1 see you now &mdash; be brave, you too,  so men to come will sing your praises down the years.  But now 1 must go back to my swift trim ship  and all my shipmates, chafing there, I'm sure,  waiting for my return. It all rests with you.  Take my words to heart.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Oh stranger,&quot;  heedful Telemachus replied, &quot;indeed 1 will.  You've counseled me with so much kindness now,  like a father to a son. 1 won't forget a word.  But come, stay longer, keen as you are to sail,  so you can bathe and rest and lift your spirits,  then go back to your ship, delighted with a gift,  a prize of honor, something rare and fine  as a keepsake from myself. The kind of gift  a host will give a stranger, friend to friend.&quot; </p>

<p>Her eyes glinting, Pallas declined in haste:  &quot;Not now. Don't hold me here. 1 long to be on my way.  As for the gift &mdash; whatever you'd give in kindness &mdash;  save it for my return so 1 can take it home.  Choose something rare and fine, and a good reward  that gift is going to bring you.&quot; </p>

<p>With that promise. </p>

<p></p>

<p>off and away Athena the bright-eyed goddess flew </p>

<p>Uke a bird in soaring flight </p>

<p>but left his spirit filled with nerve and courage, </p>

<p>charged with his father's memory more than ever now. </p>

<p>He felt his senses quicken, overwhelmed with wonder &mdash; </p>

<p>this was a god, he knew it well and made at once </p>

<p>for the suitors, a man like a god himself. </p>

<p>Amidst them still </p>

<p>the famous bard sang on, and they sat in silence, listening  as he performed The Achaeans' Journey Home from Troy,  all the blows Athena doomed them to endure. </p>

<p>And now, </p>

<p>from high above in her room and deep in thought, </p>

<p>she caught his inspired strains ... </p>

<p>Icarius' daughter Penelope, wary and reserved, </p>

<p>and down the steep stair from her chamber she descended, </p>

<p>not alone: two of her women followed close behind. </p>

<p>That radiant woman, once she reached her suitors, </p>

<p>drawing her glistening veil across her cheeks, </p>

<p>paused now where a column propped the sturdy roof, </p>

<p>with one of her loyal handmaids stationed either side. </p>

<p>Suddenly, dissolving in tears and bursting through </p>

<p>the bard's inspired voice, she cried out, &quot;Phemius! </p>

<p>So many other songs you know to hold us spellbound, </p>

<p>works of the gods and men that singers celebrate. </p>

<p>Sing one of those as you sit beside them here </p>

<p>and they drink their wine in silence. </p>

<p>But break off this song &mdash;  the unendurable song that always rends the heart inside me ...  the unforgettable grief, it wounds me most of all!  How 1 long for my husband &mdash; alive in memory, always,  that great man whose fame resounds through Hellas  right to the depths of Argos!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Why, mother,&quot;  poised Telemachus put in sharply, &quot;why deny  our devoted bard the chance to entertain us  any way the spirit stirs him on?  Bards are not to blame &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>Zeus is to blame. He deals to each and every  laborer on this earth whatever doom he pleases.  Why fault the bard if he sings the Argives' harsh fate?  It's always the latest song, the one that echoes last  in the listeners' ears, that people praise the most.  Courage, mother. Harden your heart, and listen.  Odysseus was scarcely the only one, you know,  whose journey home was blotted out at Troy.  Others, so many others, died there too. </p>

<p>So, mother, </p>

<p>go back to your quarters. Tend to your own tasks,  the distaff and the loom, and keep the women  working hard as well. As for giving orders,  men will see to that, but 1 most of all:  /hold the reins of power in this house. &quot; </p>

<p>Astonished, </p>

<p>she withdrew to her own room. She took to heart  the clear good sense in what her son had said.  Climbing up to the lofty chamber with her women,  she fell to weeping for Odysseus, her beloved husband,  till watchful Athena sealed her eyes with welcome sleep. </p>

<p>But the suitors broke into uproar through the shadowed halls,  all of them lifting prayers to lie beside her, share her bed,  until discreet Telemachus took command: &quot;You suitors  who plague my mother, you, you insolent, overweening ...  for this evening let us dine and take our pleasure,  no more shouting now. What a fine thing it is  to listen to such a bard as we have here &mdash;  the man sings like a god. </p>

<p>But at first light  we all march forth to assembly, take our seats  so 1 can give my orders and say to you straight out:  You must leave my palace! See to your feasting elsewhere,  devour your own possessions, house to house by turns.  But if you decide the fare is better, richer here,  destroying one man's goods and going scot-free,  all right then, carve away! </p>

<p></p>

<p>But I'll cry out to the everlasting gods in hopes </p>

<p>that Zeus will pay you back with a vengeance &mdash; all of you </p>

<p>destroyed in my house while /go scot-free myself! &quot; </p>

<p>So Telemachus declared. And they all bit their lips,  amazed the prince could speak with so much daring. </p>

<p>Eupithes' son Antinous broke their silence:  &quot;Well, Telemachus, only the gods could teach you  to sound so high and mighty! Such brave talk.  1 pray that Zeus will never make youVinq of Ithaca,  though your father's crown is no doubt yours by birth.&quot; </p>

<p>But cool-headed Telemachus countered firmly:  &quot;Antinous, even though my words may offend you,  I'd be happy to take the crown if Zeus presents it.  You think that nothing worse could befall a man?  It's really not so bad to be a king. All at once  your palace grows in wealth, your honors grow as well.  But there are hosts of other Achaean princes, look &mdash;  young and old, crowds of them on our island here &mdash;  and any one of the lot might hold the throne,  now great Odysseus is dead ...  But /77be lord of my own house and servants,  all that King Odysseus won for me by force.&quot; </p>

<p>And now Eurymachus, Polybus' son, stepped in:  &quot;Surely this must lie in the gods' lap, Telemachus &mdash;  which Achaean will lord it over seagirt Ithaca.  Do hold on to your own possessions, rule your house.  God forbid that anyone tear your holdings from your hands  while men still live in Ithaca. </p>

<p>But about your guest,  dear boy, 1 have some questions. Where does he come from?  Where's his country, his birth, his father's old estates?  Did he bring some news of your father, his return?  Or did he come on business of his own?  How he leapt to his feet and off he went! </p>

<p></p>

<p>No waiting around for proper introductions. </p>

<p>And no mean man, not by the looks of him, I'd say.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Eurymachus,&quot; Telemachus answered shrewdly,  &quot;clearly my father 's journey home is lost forever.  1 no longer trust in rumors &mdash; rumors from the blue &mdash;  nor bother with any prophecy, when mother calls  some wizard into the house to ask him questions.  As for the stranger though,  the man's an old family friend, from Taphos,  wise Anchialus' son. He says his name is Mentes,  lord of the Taphian men who love their oars. &quot; </p>

<p>So he said </p>

<p>but deep in his mind he knew the immortal goddess. </p>

<p>Now the suitors turned to dance and song, </p>

<p>to the lovely beat and sway, </p>

<p>waiting for dusk to come upon them there ... </p>

<p>and the dark night came upon them, lost in pleasure. </p>

<p>Finally, to bed. Each to his own house. </p>

<p>Telemachus,  off to his bedroom built in the fine courtyard &mdash;  a commanding, lofty room set well apart &mdash;  retired too, his spirit swarming with misgivings.  His devoted nurse attended him, bearing a glowing torch,  Eurycleia the daughter of Ops, Pisenor's son.  Laertes had paid a price for the woman years ago,  still in the bloom of youth. He traded twenty oxen,  honored her on a par with his own loyal wife at home  but fearing the queen's anger, never shared her bed.  She was his grandson's escort now and bore a torch,  for she was the one of all the maids who loved  the prince the most &mdash; she'd nursed him as a baby.  He spread the doors of his snug, well-made room,  sat down on the bed and pulled his soft shirt off,  tossed it into the old woman's conscientious hands,  and after folding it neatly, patting it smooth,  she hung it up on a peg beside his corded bed,  then padded from the bedroom. </p>

<p></p>

<p>drawing the door shut with the silver hook,  sliding the door bolt home with its rawhide strap.  There all night long, wrapped in a sheep's warm fleece,  he weighed in his mind the course Athena charted. </p>

<p>Book II </p>

<p></p>

<p>Telemachus  Sets Sail </p>

<p></p>

<p>when young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more </p>

<p>the true son of Odysseus sprang from bed and dressed, </p>

<p>over his shoulder he slung his well-honed sword, </p>

<p>fastened rawhide sandals under his smooth feet </p>

<p>and stepped from his bedroom, handsome as a god. </p>

<p>At once he ordered heralds to cry out loud and clear </p>

<p>and summon the flowing-haired Achaeans to full assembly. </p>

<p>Their cries rang out. The people filed in quickly. </p>

<p>When they'd grouped, crowding the meeting grounds, </p>

<p>Telemachus strode in too, a bronze spear in his grip </p>

<p>and not alone: two sleek hounds went trotting at his heels. </p>

<p>And Athena lavished a marvelous splendor on the prince </p>

<p>so the people all gazed in wonder as he came forward, </p>

<p>the elders making way as he took his father's seat. </p>

<p>The first to speak was an old lord, Aegyptius, </p>

<p></p>

<p>stooped with age, who knew the world by heart.  For one dear son had sailed with King Odysseus,  bound in the hollow ships to the stallion-land of Troy &mdash;  the spearman Antiphus &mdash; but the brutal Cyclops killed him,  trapped in his vaulted cave, the last man the monster ate.  Three other sons he had: one who mixed with the suitors,  Eurynomus, and two kept working their father's farms.  Still, he never forgot the soldier, desolate in his grief.  In tears for the son he lost, he rose and said among them,  &quot;Hear me, men of Ithaca. Hear what 1 have to say.  Not once have we held assembly, met in session  since King Odysseus sailed in the hollow ships.  Who has summoned us now &mdash; one of the young men,  one of the old-timers? What crisis spurs him on?  Some news he's heard of an army on the march,  word he's caught firsthand so he can warn us now?  Or some other public matter he'll disclose and argue?  He's a brave man, I'd say. God be with him, too!  May Zeus speed him on to a happy end,  whatever his heart desires!&quot; </p>

<p>Winning words  with a lucky ring. Odysseus' son rejoiced;  the boy could sit no longer &mdash; fired up to speak,  he took his stand among the gathered men.  The herald Pisenor, skilled in custom's ways,  put the staff in his hand, and then the prince,  addressing old Aegyptius first, led off with, &quot;Sir,  that man is not far off &mdash; you'll soon see for yourself &mdash;  /was the one who called us all together.  Something wounds me deeply ...  not news I've heard of an army on the march,  word I've caught firsthand so 1 can warn you now,  or some other public matter I'll disclose and argue.  No, the crisis is my own. Trouble has struck my house &mdash;  a double blow. First, 1 have lost my noble father  who ruled among you years ago, each of you here,  and kindly as a father to his children. </p>

<p>But now this. </p>

<p></p>

<p>a worse disaster that soon will grind my house down,  ruin it all, and all my worldly goods in the bargain.  Suitors plague my mother &mdash; against her will &mdash;  sons of the very men who are your finest here!  They'd sooner die than approach her father's house  so Icarius himself might see to his daughter's bridal,  hand her to whom he likes, whoever meets his fancy.  Not they &mdash; they infest our palace day and night,  they butcher our cattle, our sheep, our fat goats,  feasting themselves sick, swilling our glowing wine  as if there's no tomorrow &mdash; all of it, squandered.  Now we have no man like Odysseus in command  to drive this curse from the house. We ourselves?  We're hardly the ones to fight them off. All we'd do  is parade our wretched weakness. A boy inept at battle.  Oh I'd swing to attack if 1 had the power in me.  By god, it's intolerable, what they do &mdash; disgrace,  my house a shambles! </p>

<p>You should be ashamed yourselves,  mortified in the face of neighbors living round about!  Fear the gods' wrath &mdash; before they wheel in outrage  and make these crimes recoil on your heads.  1 beg you by Olympian Zeus, by Themis too,  who sets assemblies free and calls us into session &mdash;  stop, my friends! Leave me alone to pine away in anguish ...  Unless, of course, you think my noble father Odysseus  did the Achaean army damage, deliberate harm,  and to pay me back you'd do me in, deliberately  setting these parasites against me. Better for me  if youynere devouring all my treasure, all my cattle &mdash;  if you were the ones, we'd make amends in no time.  We'd approach you for reparations round the town,  demanding our goods till you'd returned the lot.  But now, look, you load my heart with grief &mdash;  there's nothing 1 can do!&quot; </p>

<p>Filled with anger,  down on the ground he dashed the speaker's scepter &mdash;  bursting into tears. Pity seized the assembly. </p>

<p></p>

<p>All just sat there, silent ... </p>

<p>no one had the heart to reply with harshness. </p>

<p>Only Antinous, who found it in himself to say, </p>

<p>&quot;So high and mighty, Telemachus &mdash; such unbridled rage! </p>

<p>Well now, fling your accusations at us? </p>

<p>Think to pin the blame on us?Yo\x think again. </p>

<p>It's not the suitors here who deserve the blame, </p>

<p>it's your own dear mother, the matchless queen of cunning. </p>

<p>Look here. For three years now, getting on to four, </p>

<p>she's played it fast and loose with all our hearts, </p>

<p>building each man's hopes &mdash; </p>

<p>dangUng promises, dropping hints to each &mdash; </p>

<p>but all the while with something else in mind. </p>

<p>rA/5 was her latest masterpiece of guile: </p>

<p>she set up a great loom in the royal halls </p>

<p>and she began to weave, and the weaving finespun, </p>

<p>the yarns endless, and she would lead us on: 'Young men, </p>

<p>my suitors, now that King Odysseus is no more, </p>

<p>go slowly, keen as you are to marry me, until </p>

<p>1 can finish off this web ... </p>

<p>so my weaving won't all fray and come to nothing. </p>

<p>This is a shroud for old lord Laertes, for that day </p>

<p>when the deadly fate that lays us out at last will take him down. </p>

<p>1 dread the shame my countrywomen would heap upon me, </p>

<p>yes, if a man of such wealth should lie in state </p>

<p>without a shroud for cover.' </p>

<p>Her very words,  and despite our pride and passion we believed her.  So by day she'd weave at her great and growing web &mdash;  by night, by the light of torches set beside her,  she would unravel all she'd done. Three whole years  she deceived us blind, seduced us with this scheme ...  Then, when the wheeling seasons brought the fourth year on,  one of her women, in on the queen's secret, told the truth  and we caught her in the act &mdash; unweaving her gorgeous web.  So she finished it off. Against her will. We forced her. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Now Telemachus, here is how the suitors answer you &mdash;  you burn it in your mind, you and all our people:  send your mother back! Direct her to marry  whomever her father picks, whoever pleases her.  So long as she persists in tormenting us,  quick to exploit the gifts Athena gave her &mdash;  a skilled hand for elegant work, a fine mind  and subtle wiles too &mdash; we've never heard the like,  not even in old stories sung of all Achaea's  well-coifed queens who graced the years gone by:  Mycenae crowned with garlands. Tyro and Alcmena ...  Not one could touch Penelope for intrigue,  but in this case she intrigued beyond all limits.  So, we will devour your worldly goods and wealth  as long as sAf holds out, holds to that course  the gods have charted deep inside her heart.  Great renown she wins for herself, no doubt,  great loss for you in treasure. We'll not go back  to our old estates or leave for other parts,  not till she weds the Argive man she fancies.&quot; </p>

<p>But with calm good sense Telemachus replied:  &quot;Antinous, how can 1 drive my mother from our house  against her will, the one who bore me, reared me too?  My father is worlds away, dead or alive, who knows?  Imagine the high price I'd have to pay Icarius  if all on my own 1 send my mother home.  Oh what 1 would suffer from her father &mdash;  and some dark god would hurt me even more  when mother, leaving her own house behind,  calls down her withering Furies on my head,  and our people's cries of shame would hound my heels.  1 will never issue that ultimatum to my mother.  And you, if you have any shame in your own hearts,  you must leave my palace! See to your feasting elsewhere,  devour your own possessions, house to house by turns.  But if you decide the fare is better, richer here,  destroying one man's goods and going scot-free,  all right then, carve away! </p>

<p></p>

<p>But I'll cry out to the everlasting gods in hopes </p>

<p>that Zeus will pay you back with a vengeance &mdash; all of you </p>

<p>destroyed in my house while /go scot-free myself!&quot; </p>

<p>And to seal his prayer, farseeing Zeus sent down a sign.  He launched two eagles soaring high from a mountain ridge  and down they glided, borne on the wind's draft a moment,  wing to wingtip, pinions straining taut till just  above the assembly's throbbing hum they whirled,  suddenly, wings thrashing, wild onslaught of wings  and banking down at the crowd's heads &mdash; a glaring, fatal sign &mdash;  talons slashing each other, tearing cheeks and throats  they swooped away on the right through homes and city.  All were dumbstruck, watching the eagles trail from sight,  people brooding, deeply, what might come to pass ...  Until the old warrior Halitherses,  Master's son, broke the silence for them:  the one who outperformed all men of his time  at reading bird-signs, sounding out the omens,  rose and spoke, distraught for each man there:  &quot;Hear me, men of Ithaca! Hear what 1 have to say,  though my revelations strike the suitors first of all &mdash;  a great disaster is rolling like a breaker toward their heads.  Clearly Odysseus won't be far from loved ones any longer &mdash;  now, right now, he's somewhere near, 1 tell you,  breeding bloody death for all these suitors here,  pains aplenty too for the rest of us who live  in Ithaca's sunlit air. </p>

<p>Long before that,  we must put heads together, find some way  to stop these men, or let them stop themselves.  Better for them that way, by far. 1 myself  am no stranger to prophecy &mdash; 1 can see it now!  Odysseus ... all is working out for him, 1 say,  just as 1 said it would that day the Argives sailed  for Troy and the mastermind of battle boarded with them.  1 said then: after many blows, and all his shipmates lost,  after twenty years had wheeled by, he would come home. </p>

<p></p>

<p>unrecognized by all ... </p>

<p>and now, look, it all comes to pass!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Stop, old man!&quot;  Eurymachus, Polybus' son, rose up to take him on.  &quot;Go home and babble your omens to your children &mdash;  save tJiem from some catastrophe coming soon.  I'm a better hand than you at reading portents.  Flocks of birds go fluttering under the sun's rays,  not all are fraught with meaning. Odysseus?  He's dead now, far from home &mdash;  would to god that you'd died with him too.  We'd have escaped your droning prophecies then  and the way you've loosed the dogs of this boy's anger &mdash;  your eyes peeled for a house-gift he might give you.  Here's /72f/ prophecy, bound to come to pass.  If you, you old codger, wise as the ages,  talk him round, incite the boy to riot,  he'll be the first to suffer, let me tell you.  And you, old man, we'll clap some fine on you  you'll weep to pay, a fine to crush your spirit! </p>

<p>Telemachus?  Here in front of you all, here's my advice for Ajm.  Let him urge his mother back to her father's house &mdash;  her kin will arrange the wedding, provide the gifts,  the array that goes with a daughter dearly loved.  Not till then, I'd say, will the island princes quit  their taxing courtship. Who's there to fear? 1 ask you.  Surely not Telemachus, with all his tiresome threats.  Nor do we balk, old man, at the prophecies you mouth &mdash;  they'll come to grief, they'll make us hate you more.  The prince's wealth will be devoured as always,  mercilessly &mdash; no reparations, ever ... not  while the queen drags out our hopes to wed her,  waiting, day after day, all of us striving hard  to win one matchless beauty. Never courting others,  bevies of brides who'd suit each noble here.&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>Telemachus answered, firm in his resolve:  &quot;Eurymachus &mdash; the rest of you fine, brazen suitors &mdash;  I have done with appeals to you about these matters.  I'll say no more. The gods know how things stand  and so do all the Achaeans. And now all 1 ask  is a good swift ship and a crew of twenty men  to speed me through my passage out and back.  I'm sailing off to Sparta, sandy Pylos too,  for news of my long-lost father's journey home.  Someone may tell me something  or 1 may catch a rumor straight from Zeus,  rumor that carries news to men like nothing else.  Now, if 1 hear my father's alive and heading home,  hard-pressed as 1 am, I'll brave out one more year.  If 1 hear he's dead, no longer among the living,  then back I'll come to the native land 1 love,  raise his grave-mound, build his honors high  with the full funeral rites that he deserves &mdash;  and give my mother to another husband.&quot; </p>

<p>A declaration,  and the prince sat down as Mentor took the floor,  Odysseus' friend-in-arms to whom the king,  sailing off to Troy, committed his household,  ordering one and all to obey the old man  and he would keep things steadfast and secure.  With deep concern for the realm, he rose and warned,  &quot;Hear me, men of Ithaca. Hear what 1 have to say.  Never let any sceptered king be kind and gentle now,  not with all his heart, or set his mind on justice &mdash;  no, let him be cruel and always practice outrage.  Think: not one of the people whom he ruled  remembers Odysseus now, that godlike man,  and kindly as a father to his children!  1 don't grudge these arrogant suitors for a moment,  weaving their violent work with all their wicked hearts &mdash;  they lay their lives on the line when they consume  Odysseus' worldly goods, blind in their violence,  telling themselves that he'll come home no more.  But all the rest of you, how you rouse my fury! </p>

<p></p>

<p>Sitting here in silence ... </p>

<p>never a word put forth to curb these suitors, </p>

<p>paltry few as they are and you so many.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Mentor!&quot; </p>

<p>Euenor 's son Leocritus rounded on him, shouting, </p>

<p>&quot;Rabble-rousing fool, now what's this talk? </p>

<p>Goading them on to try and hold us back! </p>

<p>It's uphill work, 1 warn you, </p>

<p>fighting a force like ours &mdash; for just a meal. </p>

<p>Even if Odysseus of Ithaca did arrive in person, </p>

<p>to find us well-bred suitors feasting in his halls, </p>

<p>and the man were hell-bent on routing us from the palace &mdash; </p>

<p>little joy would his wife derive from his return, </p>

<p>for all her yearning. Here on the spot he'd meet </p>

<p>a humiliating end if he fought against such odds. </p>

<p>You're talking nonsense &mdash; idiocy. </p>

<p>No more. Come,  dissolve the assembly. Each man return to his holdings.  Mentor and Halitherses can speed our young prince on,  his father's doddering friends since time began.  He'll sit tight a good long while, 1 trust,  scrabbling for news right here in Ithaca &mdash;  he'll never make that trip.&quot; </p>

<p>This broke up the assembly, keen to leave.  The people scattered quickly, each to his own house,  while the suitors strolled back to King Odysseus' palace. </p>

<p>Telemachus, walking the beach now, far from others,  washed his hands in the foaming surf and prayed to Pallas:  &quot;Dear god, hear me! Yesterday you came to my house,  you told me to ship out on the misty sea and learn  if father, gone so long, is ever coming home ...  Look how my countrymen &mdash; the suitors most of all,  the pernicious bullies &mdash; foil each move 1 make.&quot; </p>

<p>Athena came to his prayer from close at hand,  for all the world with Mentor's build and voice. </p>

<p></p>

<p>and she urged him on with winging words: &quot;Telemachus, </p>

<p>you'll lack neither courage nor sense from this day on, </p>

<p>not if your father's spirit courses through your veins &mdash; </p>

<p>now there was a man, I'd say, in words and action both! </p>

<p>So how can your journey end in shipwreck or defeat? </p>

<p>Only if you were not his stock, Penelope's too, </p>

<p>then I'd fear your hopes might come to grief. </p>

<p>Few sons are the equals of their fathers; </p>

<p>most fall short, all too few surpass them. </p>

<p>But you, brave and adept from this day on &mdash; </p>

<p>Odysseus' cunning has hardly given out in you &mdash; </p>

<p>there's every hope that you will reach your goal. </p>

<p>Put them out of your mind, these suitors' schemes and plots. </p>

<p>They 're madmen. Not a shred of sense or decency in the crowd. </p>

<p>Nor can they glimpse the death and black doom hovering </p>

<p>just at their heads to crush them all in one short day. </p>

<p>But you, the journey that stirs you now is not far off, </p>

<p>not with the likes of me, your father's friend and yours, </p>

<p>to rig you a swift ship and be your shipmate too. </p>

<p>Now home you go and mix with the suitors there. </p>

<p>But get your rations ready, </p>

<p>pack them all in vessels, the wine in jars, </p>

<p>and barley -meal &mdash; ^the marrow of men's bones &mdash; </p>

<p>in durable skins, while 1 make rounds in town </p>

<p>and quickly enlist your crew of volunteers. </p>

<p>Lots of ships in seagirt Ithaca, old and new. </p>

<p>I'll look them over, choose the best in sight, </p>

<p>we'll fit her out and launch her into the sea at once!&quot; </p>

<p>And so Athena, daughter of Zeus, assured him.  No lingering now &mdash; he heard the goddess' voice &mdash;  but back he went to his house with aching heart  and there at the palace found the brazen suitors  skinning goats in the courtyard, singeing pigs for roasting.  Antinous, smiling warmly, sauntered up to the prince,  grasped his hand and coaxed him, savoring his name:  &quot;Telemachus, my high and mighty, fierce young friend,  no more nursing those violent words and actions now. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Come, eat and drink with us, just like the old days.  Whatever you want our people will provide. A ship  and a picked crew to speed you to holy Pylos,  out for the news about your noble father.&quot; </p>

<p>But self-possessed Telemachus drew the line:  &quot;Antinous, now how could 1 dine with you in peace  and take my pleasure? You ruffians carousing here!  Isn't it quite enough that you, my mother's suitors,  have ravaged it all, my very best, these many years,  while 1 was still a boy? But now that I'm full-grown  and can hear the truth from others, absorb it too &mdash;  now, yes, that the anger seethes inside me ...  I'll stop at nothing to hurl destruction at your heads,  whether 1 go to Pylos or sit tight here at home.  But the trip 1 speak of will not end in failure.  Go 1 will, as a passenger, nothing more,  since 1 don't seem to command my own crew.  That, I'm sure, is the way that suits you best. &quot; </p>

<p>With this </p>

<p>he nonchalantly drew his hand from Antinous' hand  while the suitors, busy feasting in the halls,  mocked and taunted him, flinging insults now.  &quot;God help us,&quot; one young buck kept shouting,  &quot;he wants to slaughter us all!  He's off to sandy Pylos to hire cutthroats,  even Sparta perhaps, so hot to have our heads.  Why, he'd rove as far as Ephyra's dark rich soil  and run back home with lethal poison, slip it  into the bowl and wipe us out with drink!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Who knows?&quot; another young blade up and ventured.  &quot;Off in that hollow ship of his, he just might drown,  far from his friends, a drifter like his father.  What a bore! He'd double our work for us,  splitting up his goods, parceling out his house  to his mother and the man who weds the queen.&quot; </p>

<p>So they scoffed </p>

<p></p>

<p>but Telemachus headed down to his father's storeroom,  broad and vaulted, piled high with gold and bronze,  chests packed with clothing, vats of redolent oil.  And there, standing in close ranks against the wall,  were jars of seasoned, mellow wine, holding the drink  unmixed inside them, fit for a god, waiting the day  Odysseus, worn by hardships, might come home again.  Doors, snugly fitted, doubly hung, were bolted shut  and a housekeeper was in charge by night and day &mdash;  her care, her vigilance, guarding all those treasures &mdash;  Eurycleia the daughter of Ops, Pisenor's son.  Telemachus called her into the storeroom: &quot;Come, nurse,  draw me off some wine in smaller traveling jars,  mellow, the finest vintage you've been keeping,  next to what you reserve for our unlucky king &mdash;  in case Odysseus might drop in from the blue  and cheat the deadly spirits, make it home.  Fill me an even dozen, seal them tightly.  Pour me barley in well-stitched leather bags,  twenty measures of meal, your stone-ground best.  But no one else must know. These rations now,  put them all together. I'll pick them up myself,  toward evening, just about the time that mother  climbs to her room and thinks of turning in.  I'm sailing off to Sparta, sandy Pylos too,  for news of my dear father's journey home.  Perhaps I'll catch some rumor.&quot; </p>

<p>A wail of grief &mdash;  and his fond old nurse burst out in protest, sobbing:  &quot;Why, dear child, what craziness got into your head?  Why bent on rambling over the face of the earth? &mdash;  a darling only son! Your father's worlds away,  god's own Odysseus, dead in some strange land.  And these brutes here, just wait, the moment you're gone  they'll all be scheming against you. Kill you by guile,  they will, and carve your birthright up in pieces.  No, sit tight here, guard your own things here.  Don't go roving over the barren salt sea &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>no need to suffer so!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Courage, old woman, &quot;  thoughtful Telemachus tried to reassure her,  &quot;there's a god who made this plan.  But swear you won't say anything to my mother.  Not till ten or a dozen days have passed  or she misses me herself and learns I'm gone.  She mustn't mar her lovely face with tears.&quot; </p>

<p>The old one swore a solemn oath to the gods  and vowing she would never breathe a word,  quickly drew off wine in two-eared jars  and poured barley in well-stitched leather bags.  Telemachus returned to the hall and joined the suitors. </p>

<p>Then bright-eyed Pallas thought of one more step.  Disguised as the prince, the goddess roamed through town,  pausing beside each likely crewman, giving orders:  &quot;Gather beside our ship at nightfall &mdash; be there.&quot;  She asked Noemon, Phronius' generous son,  to lend her a swift ship. He gladly volunteered. </p>

<p>The sun sank and the roads of the world grew dark.  Now the goddess hauled the swift ship down to the water,  stowed in her all the tackle well-rigged vessels carry,  moored her well away at the harbor's very mouth  and once the crew had gathered, rallying round,  she heartened every man. </p>

<p>Then bright-eyed Pallas thought of one last thing.  Back she went to King Odysseus' halls and there  she showered sweet oblivion over the suitors,  dazing them as they drank, knocking cups from hands.  No more loitering now, their eyes weighed down with sleep,  they rose and groped through town to find their beds.  But calling the prince outside his timbered halls,  taking the build and voice of Mentor once again,  flashing-eyed Athena urged him on: &quot;Telemachus, </p>

<p></p>

<p>your comrades-at-arms are ready at the oars,  waiting for your command to launch. So come,  on with our voyage now, we're wasting time.&quot; </p>

<p>And Pallas Athena sped away in the lead  as he followed in her footsteps, man and goddess.  Once they reached the ship at the water 's edge  they found their long-haired shipmates on the beach.  The prince, inspired, gave his first commands:  &quot;Come, friends, get the rations aboard!  They 're piled in the palace now.  My mother knows nothing of this. No servants either.  Only one has heard our plan. &quot; </p>

<p>He led them back  and the men fell in and fetched down all the stores  and stowed them briskly, deep in the well-ribbed holds  as Odysseus' son directed. Telemachus climbed aboard.  Athena led the way, assuming the pilot's seat  reserved astern, and he sat close beside her.  Cables cast off, the crew swung to the oarlocks.  Bright-eyed Athena sent them a stiff following wind  rippling out of the west, ruffling over the wine-dark sea  as Telemachus shouted out commands to all his shipmates:  &quot;All lay hands to tackle!&quot; They sprang to orders,  hoisting the pinewood mast, they stepped it firm  in its block amidships, lashed it fast with stays  and with braided rawhide halyards hauled the white sail high.  Suddenly wind hit full and the canvas bellied out  and a dark blue wave, foaming up at the bow,  sang out loud and strong as the ship made way,  skimming the whitecaps, cutting toward her goal.  All running gear secure in the swift black craft,  they set up bowls and brimmed them high with wine  and poured libations out to the everlasting gods  who never die &mdash; ^to Athena first of all,  the daughter of Zeus with flashing sea-gray eyes &mdash;  and the ship went plunging all night long and through the dawn. </p>

<p>Book III </p>

<p></p>

<p>King Nestor  Remembers </p>

<p></p>

<p>As the sun sprang up, leaving the brilliant waters in its wake, </p>

<p>climbing the bronze sky to shower light on immortal gods </p>

<p>and mortal men across the plowlands ripe with grain &mdash; </p>

<p>the ship pulled into Pglos, Neleus' storied citadel, </p>

<p>where the people lined the beaches, </p>

<p>sacrificing sleek black bulls to Poseidon, </p>

<p>god of the sea-blue mane who shakes the earth. </p>

<p>They sat in nine divisions, each five hundred strong, </p>

<p>each division offering up nine bulls, and while the people </p>

<p>tasted the innards, burned the thighbones for the god, </p>

<p>the craft and crew came heading straight to shore. </p>

<p>Striking sail, furling it in the balanced ship, </p>

<p>they moored her well and men swung down on land. </p>

<p>Telemachus climbed out last, Athena far in front </p>

<p>and the bright-eyed goddess urged the prince along: </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Telemachus, no more shyness, this is not the time!  We sailed the seas for this, for news of your father &mdash;  where does he he buried? what fate did he meet?  So go right up to Nestor, breaker of horses.  We'll make him yield the secrets of his heart.  Press him yourself to tell the whole truth:  he'll never lie &mdash; the man is far too wise.&quot; </p>

<p>The prince replied, wise in his own way too,  &quot;How can 1 greet him. Mentor, even approach the king?  I'm hardly adept at subtle conversation.  Someone my age mightteeX shy, what's more,  interrogating an older man. &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Telemachus,&quot;  the bright-eyed goddess Athena reassured him,  &quot;some of the words you'll find within yourself,  the rest some power will inspire you to say.  You least of all &mdash; 1 know &mdash; </p>

<p>were born and reared without the gods' good will.&quot; </p>

<p>And Pallas Athena sped away in the lead  as he followed in her footsteps &mdash; man and goddess  gained the place where the Pylians met and massed.  There sat Nestor among his sons as friends around them  decked the banquet, roasted meats and skewered strips for broiling.  As soon as they saw the strangers, all came crowding down,  waving them on in welcome, urging them to sit.  Nestor's son Pisistratus, first to reach them,  grasped their hands and sat them down at the feast  on fleecy throws spread out along the sandbanks,  flanking his brother Thrasymedes and his father.  He gave them a share of innards, poured some wine  in a golden cup and, lifting it warmly toward Athena,  daughter of Zeus whose shield is storm and thunder,  greeted the goddess now with an invitation:  &quot;Say a prayer to lord Poseidon, stranger,  hisis the feast you've found on your arrival.  But once you've made your libation and your prayer &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>all according to ancient custom &mdash; hand this cup  of hearty, seasoned wine to your comrade here  so he can pour forth too. He too, 1 think,  should pray to the deathless ones himself.  All men need the gods ...  but the man is younger, just about my age.  That's why 1 give the gold cup first to you.&quot; </p>

<p>With that </p>

<p>Pisistratus placed in her hand the cup of mellow wine  and Pallas rejoiced at the prince's sense of tact  in giving the golden winecup first to her.  At once she prayed intensely to Poseidon:  &quot;Hear me. Sea-lord, you who embrace the earth &mdash;  don't deny our wishes, bring our prayers to pass!  First, then, to Nestor and all his sons grant glory.  Then to all these Pylians, for their splendid rites  grant a reward that warms their gracious hearts.  Last, Poseidon, grant Telemachus and myself  safe passage home, the mission accomplished  that sped us here in our rapid black ship. &quot; </p>

<p>So she prayed, and brought it all to pass.  She offered the rich two-handled cup to Telemachus,  Odysseus' son, who echoed back her prayer word for word.  They roasted the prime cuts, pulled them off the spits  and sharing out the portions, fell to the royal feast.  Once they'd put aside desire for food and drink,  old Nestor the noble charioteer began, at last:  &quot;Now's the time, now they've enjoyed their meal,  to probe our guests and find out who they are.  Strangers &mdash; friends, who are you?  Where did you sail from, over the running sea-lanes?  Out on a trading spree or roving the waves like pirates,  sea-wolves raiding at will, who risk their lives  to plunder other men?&quot; </p>

<p>Poised Telemachus answered,  filled with heart, the heart Athena herself inspired,  to ask for the news about his father, gone so long. </p>

<p></p>

<p>and make his name throughout the mortal world. </p>

<p>&quot;Nestor, son of Neleus, Achaea's pride and glory &mdash; </p>

<p>where are we from, you ask? 1 will tell you all. </p>

<p>We hail from Ithaca, under the heights of Nion. </p>

<p>Our mission here is personal, nothing public now. </p>

<p>1 am on the trail of my father's widespread fame, </p>

<p>you see, searching the earth to catch some news </p>

<p>of great-hearted King Odysseus who, they say, </p>

<p>fought with you to demolish Troy some years ago. </p>

<p>About all the rest who fought the Trojans there, </p>

<p>we know where each one died his wretched death, </p>

<p>but father ... even his death &mdash; </p>

<p>the son of Cronus shrouds it all in mystery. </p>

<p>No one can say for certain where he died, </p>

<p>whether he went down on land at enemy hands </p>

<p>or out on the open sea in Amphitrite's breakers. </p>

<p>That's why I've come to plead before you now, </p>

<p>if you can tell me about his cruel death: </p>

<p>perhaps you saw him die with your own eyes </p>

<p>or heard the wanderer's end from someone else. </p>

<p>More than all other men, that man was born for pain. </p>

<p>Don't soften a thing, from pity, respect for me &mdash; </p>

<p>tell me, clearly, all your eyes have witnessed. </p>

<p>1 beg you &mdash; if ever my father, lord Odysseus, </p>

<p>pledged you his word and made it good in action </p>

<p>once on the fields of Troy where you Achaeans suffered, </p>

<p>remember his story now, tell me the truth.&quot; </p>

<p>Nestor the noble charioteer replied at length:  &quot;Ah dear boy, since you call back such memories,  such living hell we endured in distant Troy &mdash;  we headstrong fighting forces of Achaea &mdash;  so many raids from shipboard down the foggy sea,  cruising for plunder, wherever Achilles led the way;  so many battles round King Priam's walls we fought,  so many gone, our best and bravest fell.  There Ajax lies, the great man of war. </p>

<p></p>

<p>There lies Achilles too. </p>

<p>There Patroclus, skilled as the gods in counsel. </p>

<p>And there my own dear son, both strong and staunch, </p>

<p>Antilochus &mdash; lightning on his feet and every inch a fighter! </p>

<p>But so many other things we suffered, past that count &mdash; </p>

<p>what mortal in this wide world could tell it all? </p>

<p>Not if you sat and probed his memory, five, six years, </p>

<p>delving for all the pains our brave Achaeans bore there. </p>

<p>Your patience would fray, you'd soon head for home ... </p>

<p>Nine years we wove a web of disaster for those Trojans,  pressing them hard with every tactic known to man,  and only after we slaved did Zeus award us victory.  And no one there could hope to rival Odysseus,  not for sheer cunning &mdash;  at every twist of strategy he excelled us all.  Your father, yes, if you are in fact his son ...  1 look at you and a sense of wonder takes me.  Your way with words &mdash; it's just like his &mdash; I'd swear  no youngster could ever speak like you, so apt, so telling.  As long as 1 and great Odysseus soldiered there,  never once did we speak out at odds,  neither in open muster nor in royal council:  forever one in mind, in judgment balanced, shrewd,  we mapped our armies' plans so things might turn out best.  But then, once we'd sacked King Priam's craggy city,  Zeus contrived in his heart a fatal homeward run  for all the Achaeans who were fools, at least,  dishonest too, so many met a disastrous end,  thanks to the lethal rage  of the mighty Father's daughter. Eyes afire,  Athena set them feuding, Atreus' two sons ...  They summoned all the Achaean ranks to muster,  rashly , just at sunset &mdash; no hour to rally troops &mdash;  and in they straggled, sodden with wine, our heroes.  The brothers harangued them, told them why they'd met:  a crisis &mdash; Menelaus urging the men to fix their minds </p>

<p></p>

<p>on the voyage home across the sea's broad back,  but it brought no joy to Agamemnon, not at all. </p>

<p>meant to detain us there and offer victims,  anything to appease Athena's dreadful wrath &mdash;  poor fool, he never dreamed Athena would not comply.  The minds of the everlasting gods don't change so quickly.  So the two of them stood there, wrangling, back and forth  till the armies sprang up, their armor clashing, ungodly uproar &mdash;  two plans split the ranks. That night we barely slept,  seething with hard feelings against our own comrades,  for Zeus was brooding over us, poised to seal our doom ...  At dawn, half of us hauled our vessels down to sea,  we stowed our plunder, our sashed and lovely women.  But half the men held back, camped on the beach,  waiting it out for Agamemnon's next commands  while our contingent embarked &mdash;  we pushed off and sailed at a fast clip  as a god smoothed out the huge troughing swells.  We reached Tenedos quickly, sacrificed to the gods,  the crews keen for home, but a quick return was not  in Zeus's plans, not yet: that cruel power  loosed a cursed feud on us once again.  Some swung their rolling warships hard about &mdash;  Odysseus sailed them back, the flexible, wily king,  veering over to Agamemnon now to shore his fortunes up.  Not 1. Massing the ships that came in my flotilla,  /sped away as the god's mischief kept on brewing,  dawning on me now. And Tydeus' fighting son  Diomedes fled too, rousing all his comrades.  Late in the day the red-haired Menelaus joined us,  overtook us at Lesbos, debating the long route home:  whether to head north, over the top of rocky Chios,  skirting Psy rie, keeping that island off to port  or run south of Chios, by Mimas' gusty cape.  We asked the god for a sign. He showed us one,  he urged us to cut out on the middle passage,  straight to Euboea now,  escape a catastrophe, fast as we could sail! </p>

<p></p>

<p>A shrilling wind came up, stiff, driving us on  and on we raced, over the sea-lanes rife with fish  and we made Geraestus Point in the dead of night.  Many thighs of bulls we offered Poseidon there &mdash;  thank god we'd crossed that endless reach of sea.  Then on the fourth day out the crews of Diomedes,  breaker of horses, moored their balanced ships  at Argos port, but 1 held course for Pylos, yes,  and never once did the good strong wind go limp  from the first day the god unleashed its blast. </p>

<p>And so, dear boy, 1 made it home from Troy,  in total ignorance, knowing nothing of their fates,  the ones who stayed behind:  who escaped with their lives and who went down.  But all I've gathered by hearsay, sitting here  in my own house &mdash; that you'll learn, it's only right,  I'll hide nothing now. </p>

<p>They say the Myrmidons,  those savage spearmen led by the shining son  of lionhearted Achilles, traveled home unharmed.  Philoctetes the gallant son of Poias, safe as well.  Idomeneus brought his whole contingent back to Crete,  all who'd escaped the war &mdash; ^the sea snatched none from him.  But Atreus' son Agamemnon ... you yourselves, even  in far-off Ithaca, must have heard how he returned,  how Aegisthus hatched the king's horrendous death.  But what a price Aepaid, in blood, in suffering.  Ah how fine it is, when a man is brought down,  to leave a son behind! Orestes took revenge,  he killed that cunning, murderous Aegisthus,  who'd killed his famous father. </p>

<p>And you, my friend &mdash;  how tall and handsome 1 see you now &mdash; be brave, you too,  so men to come will sing your praises down the years.&quot; </p>

<p>Telemachus, weighing the challenge closely, answered,  &quot;Oh Nestor, son of Neleus, Achaea's pride and glory. </p>

<p></p>

<p>what a stroke of revenge that was! All Achaeans </p>

<p>will spread Orestes' fame across the world, </p>

<p>a song for those to come. </p>

<p>If only the gods would arm me in such power </p>

<p>I'd take revenge on the lawless, brazen suitors </p>

<p>riding roughshod over me, plotting reckless outrage. </p>

<p>But for meihe gods have spun out no such joy , </p>

<p>for my father or myself. 1 must bear up, </p>

<p>that's all.&quot; </p>

<p>And the old charioteer replied,  &quot;Now that you mention it, dear boy, 1 do recall  a mob of suitors, they say, besets your mother  there in your own house, against your will,  and plots your ruin. Tell me, though, do you  /e/^yourself be so abused, or do people round about,  stirred up by the prompting of some god, despise you now?  Who knows if he^Ni\\ return someday to take revenge  on all their violence? Single-handed perhaps  or with an Argive army at his back? If only  the bright-eyed goddess chose to love you just  as she lavished care on brave Odysseus, years ago  in the land of Troy, where we Achaeans struggled!  I've never seen the immortals show so much affection  as Pallas openly showed AJm, standing by your father &mdash;  if only she'd favor you, tend youyNith all her heart,  many a suitor then would lose all thought of marriage,  blotted out forever.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Never, your majesty,&quot;  Telemachus countered gravely, &quot;that will never  come to pass, 1 know. What you say dumbfounds me,  staggers imagination! Hope, hope as 1 will,  that day will never dawn ...  not even if the gods should will it so.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Telemachus!&quot;  Pallas Athena broke in sharply, her eyes afire &mdash;  &quot;What's this nonsense slipping through your teeth?  It's light work for a willing god to save a mortal </p>

<p></p>

<p>even half the world away. Myself, I'd rather  sail through years of trouble and labor home  and see that blessed day, than hurry home  to die at my own hearth like Agamemnon,  killed by Aegisthus' cunning &mdash; by his own wife.  But the great leveler. Death: not even the gods  can defend a man, not even one they love, that day  when fate takes hold and lays him out at last.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Mentor,&quot; </p>

<p>wise Telemachus said, &quot;distraught as we are for him,  let's speak of this no more. My father's return?  It's inconceivable now. Long ago the undying gods  have sealed his death, his black doom. But now  there's another question 1 would put to Nestor:  Nestor excels all men for sense and justice,  his knowledge of the world.  Three generations he has ruled, they say,  and to my young eyes he seems a deathless god!  Nestor, son of Neleus, tell me the whole story &mdash;  how did the great king Agamemnon meet his death?  Where was Menelaus? What fatal trap did he set,  that treacherous Aegisthus, to bring down a man  far stronger than himself? Was Menelaus gone  from Achaean Argos, roving the world somewhere,  so the coward found the nerve to kill the king?&quot; </p>

<p>And old Nestor the noble charioteer replied:  &quot;Gladly, my boy, I'll tell you the story first to last ...  Right you are, you guess what would have happened  if red-haired Menelaus, arriving back from Troy,  had found Aegisthus alive in Agamemnon's palace.  No barrow piled high on the earth for JiJs dead body,  no, the dogs and birds would have feasted on his corpse,  sprawled on the plain outside the city gates, and no one,  no woman in all Achaea, would have wept a moment,  such a monstrous crime the man contrived!  But there we were, camped at Troy, battling out </p>

<p></p>

<p>the long hard campaign while he at his ease at home,  in the depths of Argos, stallion-country &mdash; he lay siege  to the wife of Agamemnon, luring, enticing her with talk.  At first, true, she spurned the idea of such an outrage,  Cly temnestra the queen, her will was faithful still.  And there was a man, what's more, a bard close by,  to whom Agamemnon, setting sail for Troy,  gave strict commands to guard his wife. But then,  that day the doom of the gods had bound her to surrender,  Aegisthus shipped the bard away to a desert island,  marooned him there, sweet prize for the birds of prey,  and swept her off to his own house, lover lusting for lover.  And many thighbones he burned on the gods' holy altars,  many gifts he hung on the temple walls &mdash; gold, brocades &mdash;  in thanks for a conquest past his maddest hopes. </p>

<p>Now we, </p>

<p>you see, were sailing home from Troy in the same squadron, </p>

<p>Menelaus and 1, comrades-in-arms from years of war. </p>

<p>But as we rounded holy Sounion, Athens' headland, </p>

<p>lord Apollo attacked Atrides' helmsman, aye, </p>

<p>with his gentle shafts he shot the man to death &mdash; </p>

<p>an iron grip on the tiller, the craft scudding fast &mdash; </p>

<p>Phrontis, Onetor's son, who excelled all men alive </p>

<p>at steering ships when gales bore down in fury. </p>

<p>So Menelaus, straining to sail on, was held back </p>

<p>till he could bury his mate with fitting rites. </p>

<p>But once he'd got off too, plowing the wine-dark sea </p>

<p>in his ribbed ships, and made a run to Malea's beetling cape, </p>

<p>farseeing Zeus decided to give the man rough sailing, </p>

<p>poured a hurricane down upon him, shrilling winds, </p>

<p>giant, rearing whitecaps, monstrous, mountains high. </p>

<p>There at a stroke he cut the fleet in half and drove </p>

<p>one wing to Crete, where Cydonians make their homes </p>

<p>along the lardanus River. Now, there's a sheer cliff </p>

<p>plunging steep to the surf at the farthest edge of Gorty n, </p>

<p>out on the mist-bound sea, where the South Wind piles breakers, </p>

<p>huge ones, left of the headland's horn, toward Phaestos, </p>

<p></p>

<p>with only a low reef to block the crushing tides.  In they sailed, and barely escaped their death &mdash;  the ships' crews, that is &mdash;  the rollers smashed their hulls against the rocks.  But as for the other five with pitch-black prows,  the wind and current swept them on toward Egypt. </p>

<p>So Menelaus, amassing a hoard of stores and gold,  was off cruising his ships to foreign ports of call  while Aegisthus hatched his vicious work at home.  Seven years he lorded over Mycenae rich in gold,  once he'd killed Agamemnon &mdash; he ground the people down.  But the eighth year ushered in his ruin. Prince Orestes  home from Athens, yes, he cut him down, that cunning,  murderous Aegisthus, who'd killed his famous father.  Vengeance done, he held a feast for the Argives,  to bury his hated mother, craven Aegisthus too,  the very day Menelaus arrived, lord of the war cry ,  freighted with all the wealth his ships could carry. </p>

<p>So you, </p>

<p>dear boy, take care. Don't rove from home too long, </p>

<p>too far, leaving your own holdings unprotected &mdash; </p>

<p>crowds in your palace so brazen </p>

<p>they'll carve up all your wealth, devour it all, </p>

<p>and then your journey here will come to nothing. </p>

<p>Still 1 advise you, urge you to visit Menelaus. </p>

<p>He's back from abroad at last, from people so removed </p>

<p>you might abandon hope of ever returning home, </p>

<p>once the winds had driven you that far off course, </p>

<p>into a sea so vast not even cranes could wing their way </p>

<p>in one year's flight &mdash; so vast it is, so awesome ... </p>

<p>So, off you go with your ships and shipmates now.  Or if you'd rather go by land, there's team and chariot,  my sons at your service too, and they'll escort you  to sunny Lacedaemon, home of the red-haired king.  Press him yourself to tell the whole truth: </p>

<p></p>

<p>he'll never lie &mdash; the man is far too wise.&quot; </p>

<p>So he closed </p>

<p>as the sun set and darkness swept across the earth  and the bright-eyed goddess Pallas spoke for all:  &quot;There was a tale, old soldier, so well told.  Come, cut out the victims' tongues and mix the wine,  so once we've poured libations out to the Sea-lord  and every other god, we'll think of sleep. High time &mdash;  the light's already sunk in the western shadows.  It's wrong to linger long at the gods' feast;  we must be on our way.&quot; </p>

<p>Zeus's daughter &mdash;  they all hung closely on every word she said.  Heralds sprinkled water over their hands for rinsing,  the young men brimmed the mixing bowls with wine,  they tipped first drops for the god in every cup,  then poured full rounds for all. They rose and flung  the victims' tongues on the fire and poured libations out.  When they'd poured, and drunk to their hearts' content,  Athena and Prince Telemachus both started up  to head for their ship at once.  But Nestor held them there, objecting strongly:  &quot;Zeus forbid &mdash; and the other deathless gods as well &mdash;  that you resort to your ship and put my house behind  like a rank pauper's without a stitch of clothing,  no piles of rugs, no blankets in his place  for host and guests to slumber soft in comfort.  Why, I've plenty of fine rugs and blankets here-  No, by god, the true son of my good friend Odysseus  won't bed down on a ship's deck, not while I'm alive  or my sons are left at home to host our guests,  whoever comes to our palace, newfound friends.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Dear old man, </p>

<p>you're right,&quot; Athena exclaimed, her eyes brightening now.  &quot;Telemachus should oblige you. Much the better way.  Let him follow you now, sleep in your halls,  but I'll go back to our trim black ship. </p>

<p></p>

<p>hearten the crew and give each man his orders.  I'm the only veteran in their ranks, I tell you.  All the rest, of an age with brave Telemachus,  are younger men who sailed with him as friends.  I'll bed down there by the dark hull tonight,  at dawn push off for the proud Cauconians.  Those people owe me a debt long overdue,  and no mean sum, believe me.  But you, seeing my friend is now your guest,  speed him on his way with a chariot and your son  and give him the finest horses that you have,  bred for stamina, trained to race the wind.&quot; </p>

<p>With that the bright-eyed goddess winged away  in an eagle's form and flight.  Amazement fell on all the Achaeans there.  The old king, astonished by what he'd seen,  grasped Telemachus' hand and cried out to the prince,  &quot;Dear boy &mdash; never fear you'll be a coward or defenseless,  not if at your young age the gods will guard you so.  Of all who dwell on Olympus, this was none but she,  Zeus's daughter, the glorious one, his third born,  who prized your gallant father among the Argives.  Now, 0 Queen, be gracious! Give us high renown,  myself, my children, my loyal wife and queen.  1 will make you a sacrifice, a yearling heifer  broad in the brow, unbroken, never yoked by men.  I'll offer it up to you &mdash; I'll sheathe its horns in gold.&quot; </p>

<p>So he prayed, and Pallas Athena heard his prayer.  And Nestor the noble chariot-driver led them on,  his sons and sons-in-law, back to his regal palace.  Once they reached the storied halls of the aged king  they sat on rows of low and high-backed chairs.  As they arrived the old man mixed them all a bowl,  stirring the hearty wine, seasoned eleven years  before a servant broached it, loosed its seal. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Mulling it in the bowl, old Nestor poured  a libation out, praying hard to Pallas Athena,  daughter of Zeus whose shield is storm and thunder. </p>

<p>Once they had poured their offerings, drunk their fill,  the Pylians went to rest, each in his own house.  But the noble chariot-driver let Telemachus,  King Odysseus' son, sleep at the palace now,  on a corded bed inside the echoing colonnade,  with Prince Pisistratus there beside him,  the young spearman, already captain of armies,  though the last son still unwed within the halls.  The king retired to chambers deep in his lofty house  where the queen his wife arranged and shared their bed. </p>

<p>When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more  old Nestor the noble chariot-driver climbed from bed,  went out and took his seat on the polished stones,  a bench glistening white, rubbed with glossy oil,  placed for the king before his looming doors.  There Neleus held his sessions years ago,  a match for the gods in counsel,  but his fate had long since forced him down to Death.  Now royal Nestor in turn, Achaea's watch and ward,  sat there holding the scepter while his sons,  coming out of their chambers, clustered round him,  hovering near: Echephron, Stratius, Perseus  and Aretus, Thrasymedes like a god, and sixth,  young lord Pisistratus came to join their ranks.  They escorted Prince Telemachus in to sit beside them.  Nestor, noble charioteer, began the celebration:  &quot;Quickly, my children, carry out my wishes now  so 1 may please the gods, Athena first of all &mdash;  she came to me at Poseidon's flowing feast,  Athena in all her glory!  Now someone go to the fields to fetch a heifer,  lead her here at once &mdash; a herdsman drive her in.  Someone hurry down to Prince Telemachus' black ship. </p>

<p></p>

<p>bring up all his crewmen, leave just two behind.  And another tell our goldsmith, skilled Laerces,  to come and sheathe the heifer's horns in gold.  The rest stay here together. Tell the maids  inside the hall to prepare a sumptuous feast &mdash;  bring seats and firewood, bring pure water too.&quot; </p>

<p>They all pitched in to carry out his orders.  The heifer came from the fields, the crewmen came  from brave Telemachus' ship, and the smith came in  with all his gear in hand, the tools of his trade,  the anvil, hammer and well-wrought tongs he used  for working gold. And Athena came as well  to attend her sacred rites.  The old horseman passed the gold to the smith,  and twining the foil, he sheathed the heifer's horns  so the goddess' eyes might dazzle, delighted with the gift.  Next Stratius and Echephron led the beast by the horns.  Aretus, coming up from the storeroom, brought them  lustral water filling a flower-braided bowl,  in his other hand, the barley in a basket.  Thrasymedes, staunch in combat, stood ready,  whetted ax in his grasp to cut the heifer down,  and Perseus held the basin for the blood.  Now Nestor the old charioteer began the rite.  Pouring the lustral water, scattering barley-meal,  he lifted up his ardent prayers to Pallas Athena,  launching the sacrifice, flinging onto the fire  the first tufts of hair from the victim's head. </p>

<p>Prayers said, the scattering barley strewn,  suddenly Nestor's son impetuous Thrasymedes  strode up close and struck &mdash; ^the ax chopped  the neck tendons through &mdash; </p>

<p>and the blow stunned </p>

<p>the heifer's strength &mdash; </p>

<p>The women shrilled their cry,  Nestor's daughters, sons' wives and his own loyal wife </p>

<p></p>

<p>Eurydice, Clymenus' eldest daughter. Then, hoisting up  the victim's head from the trampled earth, they held her fast  as the captain of men Pisistratus slashed her throat.  Dark blood gushed forth, life ebbed from her limbs &mdash;  they quartered her quickly, cut the thighbones out  and all according to custom wrapped them round in fat,  a double fold sliced clean and topped with strips of flesh.  And the old king burned these over dried split wood  and over the fire poured out glistening wine  while young men at his side held five-pronged forks.  Once they 'd burned the bones and tasted the organs,  they sliced the rest into pieces, spitted them on skewers  and raising points to the fire, broiled all the meats. </p>

<p>During the ritual lovely Polycaste, youngest daughter  of Nestor, Neleus' son, had bathed Telemachus.  Rinsing him off now, rubbing him down with oil,  she drew a shirt and handsome cape around him.  Out of his bath he stepped, glowing like a god,  strode in and sat by the old commander Nestor. </p>

<p>They roasted the prime cuts, pulled them off the spits  and sat down to the feast while ready stewards saw  to rounds of wine and kept the gold cups flowing.  When they'd put aside desire for food and drink,  Nestor the noble chariot-driver issued orders:  &quot;Hurry, my boys! Bring Telemachus horses,  a good fuU-maned team &mdash;  hitch them to a chariot &mdash; he must be off at once.&quot; </p>

<p>They listened closely, snapped to his commands  and hitched a rapid team to a chariot's yoke in haste.  A housekeeper stowed some bread and wine aboard  and meats too, food fit for the sons of kings.  Telemachus vaulted onto the splendid chariot &mdash;  right beside him Nestor's son Pisistratus,  captain of armies, boarded, seized the reins,  whipped the team to a run and on the horses flew. </p>

<p></p>

<p>holding nothing back, out into open country,  leaving the heights of Pylos fading in their trail,  shaking the yoke across their shoulders all day long. </p>

<p>The sun sank and the roads of the world grew dark  as they reached Phera, pulling up to Diodes' halls,  the son of Ortilochus, son of the Alpheus River.  He gave them a royal welcome; there they slept the night. </p>

<p>When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more  they yoked their pair again, mounted the blazoned car  and out through the gates and echoing colonnade  they whipped the team to a run and on they flew,  holding nothing back &mdash; and the princes reached  the wheatlands, straining now for journey's end,  so fast those purebred stallions raced them on  as the sun sank and the roads of the world grew dark. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Book IV </p>

<p></p>

<p>The King and Queen  of Sparta </p>

<p></p>

<p>At last they gained the ravines of Lacedaemon ringed by hills </p>

<p>and drove up to the halls of Menelaus in his glory. </p>

<p>They found the king inside his palace, celebrating </p>

<p>with throngs of kinsmen a double wedding-feast </p>

<p>for his son and lovely daughter. The princess </p>

<p>he was sending on to the son of great Achilles, </p>

<p>breaker of armies. Years ago Menelaus vowed, </p>

<p>he nodded assent at Troy and pledged her hand, </p>

<p>and now the gods were sealing firm the marriage. </p>

<p>So he was sending her on her way with team and chariot, </p>

<p>north to the Myrmidons' famous city governed by her groom. </p>

<p>From Sparta he brought Alector's daughter as the bride </p>

<p>for his own full-grown son, the hardy Megapenthes, </p>

<p>born to him by a slave. To Helen the gods had granted </p>

<p>no more offspring once she had borne her first child. </p>

<p></p>

<p>the breathtaking Hermione, </p>

<p>a luminous beauty gold as Aphrodite. </p>

<p>So now </p>

<p>they feasted within the grand, high-roofed palace, </p>

<p>all the kin and clansmen of Menelaus in his glory, </p>

<p>reveling warmly here as in their midst </p>

<p>an inspired bard sang out and struck his lyre &mdash; </p>

<p>and through them a pair of tumblers dashed and sprang, </p>

<p>whirling in leaping handsprings, leading on the dance. </p>

<p>The travelers, Nestor's shining son and Prince Telemachus,  had brought themselves and their horses to a standstill  just outside the court when good lord Eteoneus,  passing through the gates now, saw them there,  and the ready aide-in-arms of Menelaus  took the message through his sovereign's halls  and stepping close to his master broke the news:  &quot;Strangers have just arrived, your majesty, Menelaus.  Two men, but they look like kin of mighty Zeus himself.  Tell me, should we unhitch their team for them  or send them to someone free to host them well?&quot; </p>

<p>The red-haired king took great offense at that:  &quot;Never a fool before, Eteoneus, son of Boethous,  now 1 see you're babbling like a child!  Just think of all the hospitality ivie enjoyed  at the hands of other men before we made it home,  and god save us from such hard treks in years to come.  Quick, unhitch their team. And bring them in,  strangers, guests, to share our flowing feast.&quot; </p>

<p>Back through the halls he hurried, calling out  to other brisk attendants to follow quickly.  They loosed the sweating team from under the yoke,  tethered them fast by reins inside the horse-stalls,  tossing feed at their hoofs, white barley mixed with wheat,  and canted the chariot up against the polished walls,  shimmering in the sun, then ushered in their guests. </p>

<p></p>

<p>into that magnificent place. Both struck by the sight, </p>

<p>they marveled up and down the house of the warlord dear to Zeus &mdash; </p>

<p>a radiance strong as the moon or rising sun came flooding </p>

<p>through the high-roofed halls of illustrious Menelaus. </p>

<p>Once they'd feasted their eyes with gazing at it all, </p>

<p>into the burnished tubs they climbed and bathed. </p>

<p>When women had washed them, rubbed them down with oil </p>

<p>and drawn warm fleece and shirts around their shoulders, </p>

<p>they took up seats of honor next to Atrides Menelaus. </p>

<p>A maid brought water soon in a graceful golden pitcher </p>

<p>and over a silver basin tipped it out </p>

<p>so they might rinse their hands, </p>

<p>then pulled a gleaming table to their side. </p>

<p>A staid housekeeper brought on bread to serve them, </p>

<p>appetizers aplenty too, lavish with her bounty. </p>

<p>As a carver lifted platters of meat toward them, </p>

<p>meats of every sort, and set before them golden cups, </p>

<p>the red-haired king Menelaus greeted both guests warmly. </p>

<p>&quot;Help yourselves to food, and welcome! Once you've dined </p>

<p>we'll ask you who you are. But your parents' blood </p>

<p>is hardly lost in you. You must be born of kings, </p>

<p>bred by the gods to wield the royal scepter. </p>

<p>No mean men could sire sons like you.&quot; </p>

<p>With those words  he passed them a fat rich loin with his own hands,  the choicest part, that he'd been served himself.  They reached for the good things that lay outspread  and when they'd put aside desire for food and drink,  Telemachus, leaning his head close to Nestor's son,  spoke low to the prince so no one else could hear:  &quot;Look, Pisistratus&mdash; joy of my heart, my friend &mdash;  the sheen of bronze, the blaze of gold and amber,  silver, ivory too, through all this echoing mansion!  Surely Zeus's court on Olympus must be just like this,  the boundless glory of all this wealth inside!  My eyes dazzle ... 1 am struck with wonder.&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>But the red-haired warlord overheard his guest  and cut in quickly with winged words for both:  &quot;No man alive could rival Zeus, dear boys,  with his everlasting palace and possessions.  But among men, 1 must say, few if any  could rival mein riches. Believe me,  much 1 suffered, many a mile 1 roved to haul  such treasures home in my ships. Eight years out,  wandering off as far as Cyprus, Phoenicia, even Egypt,  1 reached the Ethiopians, Sidonians, Erembians &mdash; Libya too,  where lambs no sooner spring from the womb than they grow horns.  Three times in the circling year the ewes give birth.  So no one, neither king nor shepherd could want  for cheese or mutton, or sweet milk either,  udders swell for the sucklings round the year. </p>

<p>But while 1 roamed those lands, amassing a fortune,  a stranger killed my brother, blind to the danger, duped blind &mdash;  thanks to the cunning of his cursed, murderous queen!  So 1 rule all this wealth with no great joy .  You must have heard my story from your fathers,  whoever they are &mdash; ^what hardships 1 endured,  how 1 lost this handsome palace built for the ages,  filled to its depths with hoards of gorgeous things.  Well, would to god I'd stayed right here in my own house  with a third of all that wealth and they yN ere still alive,  all who died on the wide plain of Troy those years ago,  far from the stallion-land of Argos. </p>

<p>And still, </p>

<p>much as 1 weep for all my men, grieving sorely, </p>

<p>time and again, sitting here in the royal halls, </p>

<p>now indulging myself in tears, now brushing tears away &mdash; </p>

<p>the grief that numbs the spirit gluts us quickly &mdash; </p>

<p>for none of all those comrades, pained as 1 am, </p>

<p>do 1 grieve as much for one ... </p>

<p>that man who makes sleep hateful, even food, </p>

<p>as 1 pore over his memory. No one, no Achaean, </p>

<p>labored hard as Odysseus labored or achieved so much. </p>

<p>And how did his struggles end? In suffering for that man; </p>

<p></p>

<p>for me, in relentless, heartbreaking grief for him,  lost and gone so long now &mdash; dead or alive, who knows?  How they must mourn him too, Laertes, the old man,  and self-possessed Penelope. Telemachus as well,  the boy he left a babe in arms at home.&quot; </p>

<p>Such memories  stirred in the young prince a deep desire to grieve  for Odysseus. Tears streamed down his cheeks  and wet the ground when he heard his father's name,  both hands clutching his purple robe before his eyes.  Menelaus recognized him at once but pondered deeply  whether to let him state his father's name  or probe him first and prompt him step by step. </p>

<p>While he debated all this now within himself,  Helen emerged from her scented, lofty chamber &mdash;  striking as Artemis with her golden shafts &mdash;  and a train of women followed ...  Adreste drew up her carved reclining-chair,  Alcippe brought a carpet of soft-piled fleece,  Phylo carried her silver basket given by Alcandre,  King Polybus' wife, who made his home in Egyptian Thebes  where the houses overflow with the greatest troves of treasure.  The king gave Menelaus a pair of bathing-tubs in silver,  two tripods, ten bars of gold, and apart from these  his wife presented Helen her own precious gifts:  a golden spindle, a basket that ran on casters,  solid silver polished off with rims of gold.  Now Phylo her servant rolled it in beside her,  heaped to the brim with yarn prepared for weaving;  the spindle swathed in violet wool lay tipped across it.  Helen leaned back in her chair, a stool beneath her feet,  and pressed her husband at once for each detail:  &quot;Do we know, my lord Menelaus, who our visitors  claim to be, our welcome new arrivals?  Right or wrong, what can 1 say? My heart tells me  to come right out and say I've never seen such a likeness,  neither in man nor woman &mdash; I'm amazed at the sight. </p>

<p></p>

<p>To the life he's Uke the son of great Odysseus,  surely he's Telemachus! The boy that hero left  a babe in arms at home when all you Achaeans  fought at Troy, launching your headlong battles  just for my sake, shameless whore that 1 was.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;My dear, my dear,&quot; the red-haired king assured her,  &quot;now that you mention it, 1 see the Ukeness too ...  Odysseus' feet were like the boy 's, his hands as well,  his glancing eyes, his head, and the fine shock of hair.  Yes, and just now, as 1 was talking about Odysseus,  remembering how he struggled, suffered, all for me,  a flood of tears came streaming down his face  and he clutched his purple robe before his eyes.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Right you are&quot; &mdash; Pisistratus stepped in quickly &mdash;  &quot;son of Atreus, King Menelaus, captain of armies:  here is the son of that great hero, as you say.  But the man is modest, he would be ashamed  to make a show of himself, his first time here,  and interrupt you. We delight in your voice  as if some god were speaking!  The noble horseman Nestor sent me along  to be his escort. Telemachus yearned to see you,  so you could give him some advice or urge some action.  When a father's gone, his son takes much abuse  in a house where no one comes to his defense.  So with Telemachus now. His father's gone.  No men at home will shield him from the worst.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Wonderful!&quot; the red-haired king cried out.  &quot;The son of my dearest friend, here in my own house!  That man who performed a hundred feats of arms for me.  And 1 swore that when he came I'd give him a hero's welcome,  him above all my comrades &mdash; if only Olympian Zeus,  farseeing Zeus, had granted us both safe passage  home across the sea in our swift trim ships.  Why, I'd have settled a city in Argos for him. </p>

<p></p>

<p>built him a palace, shipped him over from Ithaca, </p>

<p>him and all his wealth, his son, his people too &mdash; </p>

<p>emptied one of the cities nestling round about us, </p>

<p>one I rule myself. Both fellow-countrymen then, </p>

<p>how often we'd have mingled side-by-side! </p>

<p>Nothing could have parted us, </p>

<p>bound by love for each other, mutual delight ... </p>

<p>till death's dark cloud came shrouding round us both. </p>

<p>But god himself, jealous of all this, no doubt, </p>

<p>robbed that unlucky man, him and him alone, </p>

<p>of the day of his return. &quot; </p>

<p>So Menelaus mused  and stirred in them all a deep desire to grieve.  Helen of Argos, daughter of Zeus, dissolved in tears,  Telemachus wept too, and so did Atreus' son Menelaus.  Nor could Nestor's son Pisistratus stay dry-eyed,  remembering now his gallant brother Antilochus,  cut down by Memnon, splendid son of the Morning.  Thinking of him, the young prince broke out:  &quot;Old Nestor always spoke of you, son of Atreus,  as the wisest man of all the men he knew,  whenever we talked about you there at home,  questioning back and forth. So now, please,  if it isn't out of place, indulge me, won't you?  Myself, 1 take no joy in weeping over supper.  Morning will soon bring time enough for that.  Not that I'd grudge a tear  for any man gone down to meet his fate.  What other tribute can we pay to wretched men  than to cut a lock, let tears roll down our cheeks?  And 1 have a brother of my own among the dead,  and hardly the poorest soldier in our ranks.  You probably knew him. 1 never met him, never  saw him myself. But they say he outdid our best,  Antilochus &mdash; lightning on his feet and every inch a fighter!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well said, my friend,&quot; the red-haired king replied.  &quot;Not even an older man could speak and do as well. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Your father's son you are &mdash; your words have all his wisdom. </p>

<p>It 's easy to spot the breed of a man whom Zeus </p>

<p>has marked for joy in birth and marriage both. </p>

<p>Take great King Nestor now: </p>

<p>Zeus has blessed him, all his livelong days, </p>

<p>growing rich and sleek in his old age at home, </p>

<p>his sons expert with spears and full of sense. </p>

<p>Well, so much for the tears that caught us just now; </p>

<p>let's think again of supper. Come, rinse our hands. </p>

<p>Tomorrow, at dawn, will offer me and Telemachus </p>

<p>time to talk and trade our thoughts in full.&quot; </p>

<p>Asphalion quickly rinsed their hands with water,  another of King Menelaus' ready aides-in arms.  Again they reached for the good things set before them. </p>

<p>Then Zeus's daughter Helen thought of something else.  Into the mixing-bowl from which they drank their wine  she slipped a drug, heart's-ease, dissolving anger,  magic to make us all forget our pains ...  No one who drank it deeply, mulled in wine,  could let a tear roll down his cheeks that day,  not even if his mother should die, his father die,  not even if right before his eyes some enemy brought down  a brother or darling son with a sharp bronze blade.  So cunning the drugs that Zeus's daughter plied,  potent gifts from Polydamna the wife of Thon,  a woman of Egypt, land where the teeming soil  bears the richest yield of herbs in all the world:  many health itself when mixed in the wine,  and many deadly poison.  Every man is a healer there, more skilled  than any other men on earth &mdash; Egyptians born  of the healing god himself. So now Helen, once  she had drugged the wine and ordered winecups filled,  resuming the conversation, entertained the group:  &quot;My royal king Menelaus &mdash; ^welcome guests here,  sons of the great as well! Zeus can present us </p>

<p></p>

<p>times of joy and times of grief in turn: </p>

<p>all lies within his power. </p>

<p>So come, let's sit back in the palace now, </p>

<p>dine and warm our hearts with the old stories. </p>

<p>1 will tell something perfect for the occasion. </p>

<p>Surely 1 can't describe or even list them all, </p>

<p>the exploits crowding fearless Odysseus' record, </p>

<p>but what a feat that hero dared and carried off </p>

<p>in the land of Troy where you Achaeans suffered! </p>

<p>Scarring his own body with mortifying strokes, </p>

<p>throwing filthy rags on his back like any slave, </p>

<p>he slipped into the enemy's city, roamed its streets &mdash; </p>

<p>all disguised, a totally different man, a beggar, </p>

<p>hardly the figure he cut among Achaea's ships. </p>

<p>That's how Odysseus infiltrated Troy, </p>

<p>and no one knew him at all ... </p>

<p>1 alone, 1 spotted him for the man he was, </p>

<p>kept questioning him &mdash; the crafty one kept dodging. </p>

<p>But after I'd bathed him, rubbed him down with oil, </p>

<p>given him clothes to wear and sworn a binding oath </p>

<p>not to reveal him as Odysseus to the Trojans, not </p>

<p>till he was back at his swift ships and shelters, </p>

<p>then at last he revealed to me, step by step, </p>

<p>the whole Achaean strategy. And once he'd cut </p>

<p>a troop of Trojans down with his long bronze sword, </p>

<p>back he went to his comrades, filled with information. </p>

<p>The rest of the Trojan women shrilled their grief. Not 1: </p>

<p>my heart leapt up &mdash; </p>

<p>my heart had changed by now &mdash; </p>

<p>1 yearned </p>

<p>to sail back home again! 1 grieved too late for the madness  Aphrodite sent me, luring me there, far from my dear land,  forsaking my own child, my bridal bed, my husband too,  a man who lacked for neither brains nor beauty.&quot; </p>

<p>And the red-haired Menelaus answered Helen:  &quot;There was a tale, my lady. So well told.  Now then, 1 have studied, in my time. </p>

<p></p>

<p>the plans and minds of great ones by the score.  And I have traveled over a good part of the world  but never once have 1 laid eyes on a man like him &mdash;  what a heart that fearless Odysseus had inside him!  What a piece of work the hero dared and carried off  in the wooden horse where all our best encamped,  our champions armed with bloody death for Troy ...  when along you came, Helen &mdash; roused, no doubt,  by a dark power bent on giving Troy some glory,  and dashing Prince Deiphobus squired your every step.  Three times you sauntered round our hollow ambush,  feeling, stroking its flanks, </p>

<p>challenging all our fighters, calling each by name &mdash; </p>

<p>yours was the voice of all our long-lost wives! </p>

<p>And Diomedes and 1, crouched tight in the midst </p>

<p>with great Odysseus, hearing you singing out, </p>

<p>were both keen to spring up and sally forth </p>

<p>or give you a sudden answer from inside, </p>

<p>but Odysseus damped our ardor, reined us back. </p>

<p>Then all the rest of the troops kept stock-still, </p>

<p>all but Anticlus. He was hot to salute you now </p>

<p>but Odysseus clamped his great hands on the man's mouth </p>

<p>and shut it, brutally &mdash; yes, he saved us all, </p>

<p>holding on grim-set till Pallas Athena </p>

<p>lured you off at last.&quot; </p>

<p>But clear-sighted Telemachus ventured,  &quot;Son of Atreus, King Menelaus, captain of armies,  so much the worse, for not one bit of that  saved himivom grisly death ...  not even a heart of iron could have helped.  But come, send us off to bed. It's time to rest,  time to enjoy the sweet relief of sleep.&quot; </p>

<p>And Helen briskly told her serving-women  to make beds in the porch's shelter, lay down  some heavy purple throws for the beds themselves,  and over them spread some blankets, thick woolly robes. </p>

<p></p>

<p>a warm covering laid on top. Torches in hand, </p>

<p>they left the hall and made up beds at once. </p>

<p>The herald led the two guests on and so they slept </p>

<p>outside the palace under the forecourt's colonnade, </p>

<p>young Prince Telemachus and Nestor's shining son. </p>

<p>Menelaus retired to chambers deep in his lofty house </p>

<p>with Helen the pearl of women loosely gowned beside him. </p>

<p>When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more  the lord of the warcry climbed from bed and dressed,  over his shoulder he slung his well-honed sword,  fastened rawhide sandals under his smooth feet,  stepped from his bedroom, handsome as a god,  and sat beside Telemachus, asking, kindly,  &quot;Now, my young prince, tell me what brings you here  to sunny Lacedaemon, sailing over the sea's broad back.  A public matter or private? Tell me the truth now.&quot; </p>

<p>And with all the poise he had, Telemachus replied,  &quot;Son of Atreus, King Menelaus, captain of armies,  1 came in the hope that you can tell me now  some news about my father. </p>

<p>My house is being devoured, my rich farms destroyed, </p>

<p>my palace crammed with enemies, slaughtering on and on </p>

<p>my droves of sheep and shambling longhorn cattle. </p>

<p>Suitors plague my mother &mdash; ^the insolent, overweening ... </p>

<p>That's why I've come to plead before you now, </p>

<p>if you can tell me about his cruel death: </p>

<p>perhaps you saw him die with your own eyes </p>

<p>or heard the wanderer's end from someone else. </p>

<p>More than all other men, that man was born for pain. </p>

<p>Don't soften a thing, from pity, respect for me &mdash; </p>

<p>tell me, clearly, all your eyes have witnessed. </p>

<p>1 beg you &mdash; if ever my father, lord Odysseus, </p>

<p>pledged you his word and made it good in action </p>

<p>once on the fields of Troy where you Achaeans suffered, </p>

<p>remember his story now, tell me the truth.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;How shameful!&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>the red-haired king burst out in anger. &quot;That's the bed </p>

<p>of a brave man of war they'd like to crawl inside, </p>

<p>those spineless, craven cowards! </p>

<p>Weak as the doe that beds down her fawns </p>

<p>in a mighty lion's den &mdash; her newborn sucklings &mdash; </p>

<p>then trails off to the mountain spurs and grassy bends </p>

<p>to graze her fill, but back the lion comes to his own lair </p>

<p>and the master deals both fawns a ghastly bloody death, </p>

<p>just what Odysseus will deal that mob &mdash; ghastly death. </p>

<p>Ah if only &mdash; Father Zeus, Athena and lord Apollo &mdash; </p>

<p>that man who years ago in the games at Lesbos </p>

<p>rose to Philomelides' challenge, wrestled him, </p>

<p>pinned him down with one tremendous throw </p>

<p>and the Argives roared with joy ... </p>

<p>if only ^Aa^ Odysseus sported with those suitors, </p>

<p>a blood wedding, a quick death would take the lot! </p>

<p>But about the things you've asked me, so intently, </p>

<p>I'll skew and sidestep nothing, not deceive you, ever. </p>

<p>Of all Aftold me &mdash; the Old Man of the Sea who never lies &mdash; </p>

<p>I'll hide or hold back nothing, not a single word. </p>

<p>It was in Egypt, where the gods still marooned me,  eager as 1 was to voyage home ... I'd failed,  you see, to render them full, flawless victims,  and gods are always keen to see their rules obeyed.  Now, there's an island out in the ocean's heavy surge,  well off the Egyptian coast &mdash; they call it Pharos &mdash;  far as a deep-sea ship can go in one day's sail  with a whistling wind astern to drive her on.  There's a snug harbor there, good landing beach  where crews pull in, draw water up from the dark wells,  then push their vessels off for passage out.  But here the gods becalmed me twenty days ...  not a breath of the breezes ruffling out to sea  that speed a ship across the ocean's broad back.  Now our rations would all have been consumed,  our crews' stamina too, if one of the gods  had not felt sorry for me, shown me mercy. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Eidothea, a daughter of Proteus, </p>

<p>that great power, the Old Man of the Sea. </p>

<p>My troubles must have moved her to the heart </p>

<p>when she met me trudging by myself without my men. </p>

<p>They kept roaming around the beach, day in, day out, </p>

<p>fishing with twisted hooks, their bellies racked by hunger. </p>

<p>Well, she came right up to me, filled with questions: </p>

<p>'Are you a fool, stranger &mdash; soft in the head and lazy too? </p>

<p>Or do you let things slide because you //Areyour pain? </p>

<p>Here you are, cooped up on an island far too long, </p>

<p>with no way out of it, none that you can find, </p>

<p>while all your shipmates' spirit ebbs away.' </p>

<p>So she prodded and 1 replied at once,  'Let me tell you, goddess &mdash; whoever you are &mdash;  I'm hardly landlocked here of my own free will.  So 1 must have angered one of the deathless gods  who rule the skies up there. But you tell me &mdash;  you immortals know it all &mdash; which one of you  blocks my way here, keeps me from my voyage?  How can 1 cross the swarming sea and reach home at last?' </p>

<p>And the glistening goddess reassured me warmly,  'Of course, my friend, I'll answer all your questions.  Who haunts these parts? Proteus of Egypt does,  the immortal Old Man of the Sea who never lies,  who sounds the deep in all its depths, Poseidon's servant.  He's my father, they say, he gave me life. And he,  if only you ambush him somehow and pin him down,  will tell you the way to go, the stages of your voyage,  how you can cross the swarming sea and reach home at last.  And he can tell you too, if you want to press him &mdash;  you aredi king, it seems &mdash; </p>

<p>all that's occurred within your palace, good and bad,  while you've been gone your long and painful way.' </p>

<p>'Then you are the one' &mdash; 1 quickly took her up.  'Show me the trick to trap this ancient power. </p>

<p></p>

<p>or he'll see or sense me first and slip away.  It's hard for a mortal man to force a god.' </p>

<p>'True, my friend,' the glistening one agreed,  and again I'll tell you all you need to know.  When the sun stands striding at high noon,  then up from the waves he comes &mdash;  the Old Man of the Sea who never lies &mdash;  under a West Wind's gust that shrouds him round  in shuddering dark swells, and once he's out on land  he heads for his bed of rest in deep hollow caves  and around him droves of seals &mdash; sleek pups bred  by his lovely ocean-lady &mdash; bed down too  in a huddle, flopping up from the gray surf,  giving off the sour reek of the salty ocean depths.  I'll lead you there myself at the break of day  and couch you all for attack, side-by-side.  Choose three men from your crew, choose well,  the best you've got aboard the good decked hulls.  Now 1 will tell you all the old wizard's tricks ...  First he will make his rounds and count the seals  and once he's checked their number, reviewed them all,  down in their midst he'll lie, like a shepherd with his flock.  That's your moment. Soon as you see him bedded down,  muster your heart and strength and hold him fast,  wildly as he writhes and fights you to escape.  He'll try all kinds of escape &mdash; ^twist and turn  into every beast that moves across the earth,  transforming himself into water, superhuman fire,  but you hold on for dear life, hug him all the harder!  And when, at last, he begins to ask you questions &mdash;  back in the shape you saw him sleep at first &mdash;  relax your grip and set the old god free  and ask him outright, hero,  which of the gods is up in arms against you?  How can you cross the swarming sea and reach home at last?' </p>

<p></p>

<p>So she urged and under the breaking surf she dove  as I went back to our squadron beached in sand,  my heart a heaving storm at every step ...  Once I reached my ship hauled up on shore  we made our meal and the godsent night came down  and then we slept at the sea's smooth shelving edge.  When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more  1 set out down the coast of the wide-ranging sea,  praying hard to the gods for all their help,  taking with me the three men 1 trusted most  on every kind of mission. </p>

<p>Eidothea, now,  had slipped beneath the sea's engulfing folds  but back from the waves she came with four sealskins,  all freshly stripped, to deceive her father blind.  She scooped out lurking-places deep in the sand  and sat there waiting as we approached her post,  then couching us side-by-side she flung a sealskin  over each man's back. Now there was an ambush  that would have overpowered us all &mdash; overpowering,  true, the awful reek of all those sea-fed brutes!  Who'd dream of bedding down with a monster of the deep?  But the goddess sped to our rescue, found the cure  with ambrosia, daubing it under each man's nose &mdash;  that lovely scent, it drowned the creatures' stench.  So all morning we lay there waiting, spirits steeled,  while seals came crowding, jostling out of the sea  and flopped down in rows, basking along the surf.  At high noon the old man emerged from the waves  and found his fat-fed seals and made his rounds,  counting them off, counting usthe first four,  but he had no inkling of all the fraud afoot.  Then down he lay and slept, but we with a battle-cry,  we rushed him, flung our arms around him &mdash; he'd lost nothing,  the old rascal, none of his cunning quick techniques!  First he shifted into a great bearded lion  and then a serpent &mdash; </p>

<p>a panther &mdash; </p>

<p>a ramping wild boar &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>a torrent of water &mdash; </p>

<p>a tree with soaring branchtops &mdash;  but we held on for dear life, braving it out  until, at last, that quick-change artist,  the old wizard, began to weary of all this  and burst out into rapid-fire questions:  'Which god, Menelaus, conspired with you  to trap me in ambush? seize me against my will?  What on earth do you want?' </p>

<p>'You know, old man,'  1 countered now. Why put me off with questions?  Here 1 am, cooped up on an island far too long,  with no way out of it, none that 1 can find,  while my spirit ebbs away. But you tell me &mdash;  you immortals know it all &mdash; which one of you  blocks my way here, keeps me from my voyage?  How can 1 cross the swarming sea and reach home at last?' </p>

<p>'How wrong you were!' the seer shot back at once.  'You should have offered Zeus and the other gods  a handsome sacrifice, then embarked, if you ever hoped  for a rapid journey home across the wine-dark sea.  It's not your destiny yet to see your loved ones,  reach your own grand house, your native land at last,  not till you sail back through Egyptian waters &mdash;  the great Nile swelled by the rains of Zeus &mdash;  and make a splendid rite to the deathless gods  who rule the vaulting skies. Then, only then  will the gods grant you the voyage you desire.' </p>

<p>So he urged, and broke the heart inside me,  having to double back on the mist-bound seas,  back to Egypt, that, that long and painful way ...  Nevertheless 1 caught my breath and answered,  'That 1 will do, old man, as you command.  But tell me this as well, and leave out nothing:  Did all the Achaeans reach home in the ships unharmed,  all we left behind, Nestor and 1, en route from Troy? </p>

<p></p>

<p>Or did any die some cruel death by shipwreck </p>

<p>or die in the arms of loved ones, </p>

<p>once they 'd wound down the long coil of war?' </p>

<p>And he lost no time in saying, 'Son of Atreus,  why do you ask me that? Why do you need to know?  Why probe my mind? You won't stay dry-eyed long,  1 warn you, once you have heard the whole story.  Many of them were killed, many survived as well,  but only two who captained your bronze-armored units  died on the way home &mdash; you know who died in the fighting,  you were there yourself. </p>

<p>And one is still alive,  held captive, somewhere, off in the endless seas ... </p>

<p>Ajax, now, went down with his long-oared fleet.  First Poseidon drove him onto the cliffs of Gyrae,  looming cliffs, then saved him from the breakers &mdash;  he'd have escaped his doom, too, despite Athena's hate,  if he hadn't flung that brazen boast, the mad blind fool.  &quot;In the teeth of the gods,&quot; he bragged, &quot;1 have escaped  the ocean's sheer abyss!&quot; Poseidon heard that frantic vaunt  and the god grasped his trident in both his massive hands  and struck the Gyraean headland, hacked the rock in two,  and the giant stump stood fast but the jagged spur  where Ajax perched at first, the raving madman &mdash;  toppling into the sea, it plunged him down, down  in the vast, seething depths. And so he died,  having drunk his fill of brine. </p>

<p>Your brother?  He somehow escaped that fate; Agamemnon got away  in his beaked ships. Queen Hera pulled him through.  But just as he came abreast of Malea's beetling cape  a hurricane snatched him up and swept him way off course &mdash;  groaning, desperate &mdash; driving him over the fish-infested sea  to the wild borderland where Thgestes made his home  in days of old and his son Aegisthus lived now.  But even from there a safe return seemed likely. </p>

<p></p>

<p>yes, the immortals swung the wind around to fair </p>

<p>and the victors sailed home. How rejoiced, </p>

<p>Atrides setting foot on his fatherland once more &mdash; </p>

<p>he took that native earth in his hands and kissed it, </p>

<p>hot tears flooding his eyes, so thrilled to see his land! </p>

<p>But a watchman saw him too &mdash; from a lookout high above &mdash; </p>

<p>a spy that cunning Aegisthus stationed there, </p>

<p>luring the man with two gold bars in payment. </p>

<p>One whole year he'd watched ... </p>

<p>so the great king would not get past unseen. </p>

<p>his fighting power intact for self-defense. </p>

<p>The spy ran the news to his master 's halls </p>

<p>and Aegisthus quickly set his stealthy trap. </p>

<p>Picking the twenty best recruits from town </p>

<p>he packed them in ambush at one end of the house, </p>

<p>at the other he ordered a banquet dressed and spread </p>

<p>and went to welcome the conquering hero, Agamemnon, </p>

<p>went with team and chariot, and a mind aswarm with evil. </p>

<p>Up from the shore he led the king, he ushered him in &mdash; </p>

<p>suspecting nothing of all his doom &mdash; he feasted him well </p>

<p>then cut him down as a man cuts down some ox at the trough! </p>

<p>Not one of your brother's men-at-arms was left alive, </p>

<p>none of Aegisthus' either. All, killed in the palace.' </p>

<p>So Proteus said, and his story crushed my heart.  1 knelt down in the sand and wept. I'd no desire  to go on living and see the rising light of day.  But once I'd had my fill of tears and writhing there,  the Old Man of the Sea who never lies continued,  'No more now, Menelaus. How long must you weep?  Withering tears, what good can come of tears?  None 1 know of. Strive instead to return  to your native country &mdash; hurry home at once!  Either you'll find the murderer still alive  or Orestes will have beaten you to the kill.  You'll be in time to share the funeral feast.' </p>

<p></p>

<p>So he pressed, and I felt my heart, my old pride,  for all my grieving, glow once more in my chest  and 1 asked the seer in a rush of winging words,  'Those two 1 know now. Tell me the third man's name.  Who is still alive, held captive off in the endless seas?  Unless he's dead by now. 1 want to know the truth  though it grieves me all the more.' </p>

<p>'Odysseus' &mdash;  the old prophet named the third at once &mdash;  'Laertes' son, who makes his home in Ithaca ...  1 saw him once on an island, weeping live warm tears  in the nymph Calypso's house &mdash; she holds him there by force.  He has no way to voyage home to his own native land,  no trim ships in reach, no crew to ply the oars  and send him scudding over the sea's broad back.  But about your destiny, Menelaus, dear to Zeus,  it's not for you to die </p>

<p>and meet your fate in the stallion-land of Argos,  no, the deathless ones will sweep you off to the world's end,  the Elysian Fields, where gold-haired Rhadamanthys waits,  where life glides on in immortal ease for mortal man;  no snow, no winter onslaught, never a downpour there  but night and day the Ocean River sends up breezes,  singing winds of the West refreshing all mankind.  All this because you are Helen's husband now &mdash;  the gods count you the son-in-law of Zeus.' </p>

<p>So he divined and down the breaking surf he dove  as 1 went back to the ships with my brave men,  my heart a rising tide at every step.  Once 1 reached my craft hauled up on shore  we made our meal and the godsent night came down  and then we slept at the sea's smooth shelving edge.  When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more  we hauled the vessels down to the sunlit breakers first  then stepped the masts amidships, canvas brailed &mdash;  the crews swung aboard, they sat to the oars in ranks  and in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke.  Back we went to the Nile swelled by the rains of Zeus, </p>

<p></p>

<p>I moored the ships and sacrificed in a splendid rite,  and once I'd slaked the wrath of the everlasting gods  I raised a mound for Agamemnon, his undying glory.  All this done, 1 set sail and the gods sent me  a stiff following wind that sped me home,  home to the native land 1 love. </p>

<p>But come, </p>

<p>my boy, stay on in my palace now with me, </p>

<p>at least till ten or a dozen days have passed. </p>

<p>Then I'll give you a princely send-off &mdash; shining gifts, </p>

<p>three stallions and a chariot burnished bright &mdash; </p>

<p>and I'll add a gorgeous cup so you can pour </p>

<p>libations out to the deathless gods on high </p>

<p>and remember Menelaus all your days.&quot; </p>

<p>Telemachus,  summoning up his newfound tact, replied,  &quot;Please, Menelaus, don't keep me quite so long.  True, I'd gladly sit beside you one whole year  without a twinge of longing for home or parents.  It's wonderful how you tell your stories, all you say &mdash;  1 delight to listen! Yes, but now, I'm afraid,  my comrades must be restless in sacred Pylos,  and here you'd hold me just a little longer.  As for the gift you give me, let it be a keepsake.  Those horses 1 really cannot take to Ithaca;  better to leave them here to be your glory.  You rule a wide level plain  where the fields of clover roll and galingale  and wheat and oats and glistening full-grain barley.  No running-room for mares in Ithaca though, no meadows.  Goat, not stallion, land, yet it means the world to me.  None of the rugged islands slanting down to sea  is good for pasture or good for bridle paths,  but Ithaca, best of islands, crowns them all!&quot; </p>

<p>So he declared. The lord of the warcry smiled,  patted him with his hand and praised his guest, concluding,  &quot;Good blood runs in you, dear boy, your words are proof. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Certainly I'll exchange the gifts. The power's mine.  Of all the treasures lying heaped in my palace  you shall have the finest, most esteemed. Why,  I'll give you a mixing-bowl, forged to perfection &mdash;  it's solid silver finished off with a lip of gold.  Hephaestus made it himself. And a royal friend,  Phaedimus, king of Sidon, lavished it on me  when his palace welcomed me on passage home.  How pleased I'd be if you took it as a gift! &quot; </p>

<p>And now as the two confided in each other,  banqueters arrived at the great king's palace,  leading their own sheep, bearing their hearty wine,  and their wives in lovely headbands sent along the food.  And so they bustled about the halls preparing dinner ...  But all the while the suitors, before Odysseus' palace,  amused themselves with discus and long throwing spears,  out on the leveled grounds, free and easy as always,  full of swagger. But lord Antinous sat apart,  dashing Eurymachus beside him, ringleaders,  head and shoulders the strongest of the lot.  Phronius' son Noemon approached them now,  quick to press Antinous with a question:  &quot;Antinous, have we any notion or not  when Telemachus will return from sandy Pylos?  He sailed in a ship of mine and now 1 need her back  to cross over to Elis Plain where 1 keep a dozen horses,  brood-mares suckling some heavy-duty mules, unbroken.  I'd like to drive one home and break him in.&quot; </p>

<p>That dumbfounded them both. They never dreamed  the prince had gone to Pylos, Neleus' city &mdash;  certain the boy was still nearby somewhere,  out on his farm with flocks or with the swineherd. </p>

<p>&quot;Tell me the truth!&quot; Antinous wheeled on Noemon.  &quot;When did he go? And what young crew went with him?  Ithaca's best? Or his own slaves and servants? </p>

<p></p>

<p>Surely he has enough to man a ship. </p>

<p>Tell me this &mdash; be clear &mdash; I've got to know: </p>

<p>did he commandeer your ship against your will </p>

<p>or did you volunteer it once he'd won you over?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;1 volunteered it, of course, &quot; Noemon said.  &quot;What else could anyone do, when such a man,  a prince weighed down with troubles,  asked a favor? Hard to deny him anything.  And the young crew that formed his escort? Well,  they're the finest men on the island, next to us.  And Mentor took command &mdash; 1 saw him climb aboard &mdash;  or a god who looked like Mentor head to foot,  and that's what 1 find strange. 1 saw good Mentor  yesterday, just at sunup, here. But clearly  he boarded ship for Pylos days ago.&quot; </p>

<p>With that he headed back to his father's house,  leaving the two lords stiff with indignation.  They made the suitors sit down in a group  and stop their games at once. Eupithes' son  Antinous rose up in their midst to speak,  his dark heart filled with fury,  blazing with anger &mdash; eyes like searing fire:  &quot;By god, what a fine piece of work he's carried off!  Telemachus &mdash; ^what insolence &mdash; and we thought his little jaunt  would come to grief. But in spite of us all, look,  the young cub slips away , just like that&mdash;  picks the best crew in the land and off he sails.  And this is just the start of the trouble he can make.  Zeus kill that brazen boy before he hits his prime!  Quick, fetch me a swift ship and twenty men &mdash;  I'll waylay him from ambush, board him coming back  in the straits between Ithaca and rocky Same.  This gallant voyage of his to find his father  will find wrecked at last!&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>They all roared approval, urged him on,  rose at once and retired to Odysseus' palace. </p>

<p>But not for long was Penelope unaware  of the grim plots her suitors planned in secret.  The herald Medon told her. He'd overheard their schemes,  listening in outside the court while they wove on within.  He rushed the news through the halls to tell the queen  who greeted him as he crossed her chamber 's threshold:  &quot;Herald, why have the young blades sent you now?  To order King Odysseus' serving- women  to stop their work and slave to fix their feast?  1 hate their courting, their running riot here &mdash;  would to god that this meal, here and now,  were their last meal on earth! </p>

<p>Day after day,  all of you swarming, draining our life's blood,  my wary son's estate. What, didn't you listen  to your fathers &mdash; when you were children, years ago &mdash;  telling you how Odysseus treated them, your parents?  Never an unfair word, never an unfair action  among his people here, though that's the way  of our god-appointed kings,  hating one man, loving the next, with luck.  Not Odysseus. Never an outrage done to any man alive.  But you, you and your ugly outbursts, shameful acts,  they're plain to see. Look at the thanks he gets  for all past acts of kindness!&quot; </p>

<p>Medon replied,  sure of his own discretion, &quot;Ah my queen,  if only tJiatyNsre the worst of all you face.  Now your suitors are plotting something worse,  harsher, cruder. God forbid they bring it off!  They 're poised to cut Telemachus down with bronze swords  on his way back home. He's sailed off, you see ...  for news of his father &mdash; ^to sacred Pylos first,  then out to the sunny hills of Lacedaemon.&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>Her knees gave way on the spot, her heart too.  She stood there speechless a while, struck dumb,  tears filling her eyes, her warm voice choked.  At last she found some words to make reply:  &quot;Oh herald, why has my child gone and left me?  No need in the world for him to board the ships,  those chariots of the sea that sweep men on,  driving across the ocean's endless wastes ...  Does he want his very name wiped off the earth?&quot; </p>

<p>Medon, the soul of thoughtfulness, responded,  &quot;1 don't know if a god inspired your son  or the boy 's own impulse led him down to Pylos,  but he went to learn of his father's journey home,  or whatever fate he's met.&quot; </p>

<p>Back through King Odysseus' house he went  but a cloud of heartbreak overwhelmed the queen.  She could bear no longer sitting on a chair  though her room had chairs aplenty.  Down she sank on her well-built chamber's floor,  weeping, pitifully, as the women whimpered round her,  all the women, young and old, who served her house.  Penelope, sobbing uncontrollably, cried out to them,  &quot;Hear me, dear ones! Zeus has given me torment &mdash;  me above all the others born and bred in my da\^.  My lionhearted husband, lost, long years ago,  who excelled the Argives all in every strength &mdash;  that great man whose fame resounds through Hellas  right to the depths of Argos! </p>

<p>But now my son,  my darling boy &mdash; the whirlwinds have ripped him  out of the halls without a trace! 1 never heard  he'd gone &mdash; not even from you, you hard, heartless ...  not one of you even thought to rouse me from my bed,  though well you knew when he boarded that black ship.  Oh if only 1 had learned he was planning such a journey ,  he would have stayed, by god, keen as he was to sail &mdash;  or left me dead right here within our palace. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Go, someone, quickly! Call old Dolius now,  the servant my father gave me when 1 came,  the man who tends my orchard green with trees,  so he can run to Laertes, sit beside him,  tell him the whole story, blow-by-blow.  Perhaps &mdash; who knows? &mdash; he'll weave some plan,  he'll come out of hiding, plead with all these people  mad to destroy his line, his son's line of kings! &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Oh dear girl, &quot; Eurycleia the fond old nurse replied,  &quot;kill me then with a bronze knife &mdash; no mercy &mdash; or let me live,  here in the palace &mdash; I'll hide nothing from you now!  1 knew it all, 1 gave him all he asked for,  bread and mellow wine, but he made me take  a mighty oath that 1, 1 wouldn't tell you,  no, not till ten or a dozen days had passed  or you missed the lad yourself and learned he'd gone,  so tears would never mar your lovely face ...  Come, bathe now, put some fresh clothes on,  climb to the upper rooms with all your women  and pray to Pallas, daughter of storming Zeus &mdash;  5Aemay save Telemachus yet, even at death's door.  Don't worry an old man, worried enough by now.  1 can't believe the blessed gods so hate  the heirs of King Arcesius, through and through.  One will still live on &mdash; 1 know it &mdash; born to rule  this lofty house and the green fields far and wide.&quot; </p>

<p>With that </p>

<p>she lulled Penelope's grief and dried her eyes of tears.  And the queen bathed and put fresh clothing on,  climbed to the upper rooms with all her women  and sifting barley into a basket, prayed to Pallas,  &quot;Hear me, daughter of Zeus whose shield is thunder &mdash;  tireless one, Athena! If ever, here in his halls,  resourceful King Odysseus </p>

<p>burned rich thighs of sheep or oxen in your honor,  oh remember it now for my sake, save my darling son,  defend him from these outrageous, overbearing suitors! &quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>She shrilled a high cry and the goddess heard her prayer  as the suitors burst into uproar through the shadowed halls  and one of the lusty young men began to brag, &quot;Listen,  our long-courted queen's preparing us all a marriage &mdash;  with no glimmer at all </p>

<p>how the murder of her son has been decreed.&quot; </p>

<p>Boasting so, </p>

<p>with no glimmer at all of what had been decreed.  But Antinous took the floor and issued orders:  &quot;Stupid fools! Muzzle your bragging now &mdash;  before someone slips inside and reports us.  Up now, not a sound, drive home our plan &mdash;  it suits us well, we approved it one and all.&quot; </p>

<p>With that he picked out twenty first-rate men  and down they went to the swift ship at the sea's edge.  First they hauled the craft into deeper water,  stepped the mast amidships, canvas brailed,  made oars fast in the leather oarlock straps  while zealous aides-in-arms brought weapons on.  They moored her well out in the channel, disembarked  and took their meal on shore, waiting for dusk to fall. </p>

<p>But there in her upper rooms she lay, Penelope  lost in thought, fasting, shunning food and drink,  brooding now ... would her fine son escape his death  or go down at her overweening suitors' hands?  Her mind in torment, wheeling  like some lion at bay, dreading gangs of hunters  closing their cunning ring around him for the finish.  Harried so she was, when a deep kind sleep overcame her,  back she sank and slept, her limbs fell limp and still. </p>

<p>And again the bright-eyed goddess Pallas thought  of one more way to help. She made a phantom now,  its build like a woman's build, Iphthime's, yes,  another daughter of generous Lord Icarius,  Eumelus' bride, who made her home in Pherae. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Athena sped her on to King Odysseus' house  to spare Penelope, worn with pain and sobbing,  further spells of grief and storms of tears.  The phantom entered her bedroom,  passing quickly in through the doorbolt slit  and hovering at her head she rose and spoke now:  &quot;Sleeping, Penelope, your heart so wrung with sorrow?  No need, 1 tell you, no, the gods who live at ease  can't bear to let you weep and rack your spirit.  Your son will still come home &mdash; it is decreed.  He's never wronged the gods in any way.&quot; </p>

<p>And Penelope murmured back, still cautious,  drifting softly now at the gate of dreams,  &quot;Why have you come, my sister?  Your visits all too rare in the past,  for you make your home so very far away.  You tell me to lay to rest the grief and tears  that overwhelm me now, torment me, heart and soul?  With my lionhearted husband lost long years ago,  who excelled the Argives all in every strength?  That great man whose fame resounds through Hellas  right to the depths of Argos ... </p>

<p>And now my darling boy,  he's off and gone in a hollow ship! Just a youngster,  still untrained for war or stiff debate. Him,  1 mourn him even more than 1 do my husband &mdash;  quake in terror for all that he might suffer  either on open sea or shores he goes to visit.  Hordes of enemies scheme against him now,  keen to kill him off </p>

<p>before he can reach his native land again.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Courage!&quot; the shadowy phantom reassured her.  &quot;Don't be overwhelmed by all your direst fears.  He travels with such an escort, one that others  would pray to stand beside them. She has power &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>Pallas Athena. She pities you in your tears.  She wings me here to tell you all these things.&quot; </p>

<p>But the circumspect Penelope replied,  &quot;If you area, god and have heard a god's own voice,  come, tell me about that luckless man as well.  Is he still alive? does he see the light of day?  Or is he dead already, lost in the House of Death? &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;About that man, &quot; the shadowy phantom answered,  &quot;1 cannot tell you the story start to finish,  whether he's dead or alive.  It's wrong to lead you on with idle words. &quot; </p>

<p>At that </p>

<p>she glided off by the doorpost past the bolt &mdash; </p>

<p>gone on a lifting breeze. Icarius' daughter </p>

<p>started up from sleep, her spirit warmed now </p>

<p>that a dream so clear had come to her in darkest night. </p>

<p>But the suitors boarded now and sailed the sea-lanes,  plotting in their hearts Telemachus' plunge to death.  Off in the middle channel lies a rocky island,  just between Ithaca and Same's rugged cliffs &mdash;  Asteris &mdash; not large, but it has a cove,  a harbor with two mouths where ships can hide.  Here the Achaeans lurked in ambush for the prince. </p>

<p></p>

<p>BookV </p>

<p></p>

<p>Odysseus &mdash; Nymph  and Shipwreck </p>

<p></p>

<p>As Dawn rose up from bed by her lordly mate Tithonus,  bringing light to immortal gods and mortal men,  the gods sat down in council, circling Zeus  the thunder king whose power rules the world.  Athena began, recalling Odysseus to their thoughts,  the goddess deeply moved by the man's long ordeal,  held captive still in the nymph Calypso's house:  &quot;Father Zeus &mdash; you other happy gods who never die &mdash;  never let any sceptered king be kind and gentle now,  not with all his heart, or set his mind on justice &mdash;  no, let him be cruel and always practice outrage.  Think: not one of the people whom he ruled  remembers Odysseus now, that godlike man,  and kindly as a father to his children. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Now </p>

<p>he's left to pine on an island, racked with grief </p>

<p>in the nymph Calypso's house &mdash; she holds him there by force. </p>

<p>He has no way to voyage home to his own native land, </p>

<p>no trim ships in reach, no crew to ply the oars </p>

<p>and send him scudding over the sea's broad back. </p>

<p>And now his dear son ... they plot to kill the boy </p>

<p>on his way back home. Yes, he has sailed off </p>

<p>for news of his father, to holy Pylos first, </p>

<p>then out to the sunny hills of Lacedaemon.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;My child, ' Zeus who marshals the thunderheads replied,  &quot;what nonsense you let slip through your teeth. Come now,  wasn't the plan your own? You conceived it yourself:  Odysseus shall return and pay the traitors back.  Telemachus? Sail him home with all your skill &mdash;  the power is yours, no doubt &mdash;  home to his native country all unharmed  while the suitors limp to port, defeated, baffled men.&quot; </p>

<p>With those words, Zeus turned to his own son Hermes.  &quot;You are our messenger, Hermes, sent on all our missions.  Announce to the nymph with lovely braids our fixed decree:  Odysseus journeys home &mdash; ^the exile must return.  But not in the convoy of the gods or mortal men.  No, on a lashed, makeshift raft and wrung with pains,  on the twentieth day he will make his landfall, fertile Scheria,  the land of Phaeacians, close kin to the gods themselves,  who with all their hearts will prize him like a god  and send him off in a ship to his own beloved land,  giving him bronze and hoards of gold and robes &mdash;  more plunder than he could ever have won from Troy  if Odysseus had returned intact with his fair share.  So his destiny ordains. He shall see his loved ones,  reach his high-roofed house, his native land at last.&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>So Zeus decreed and the giant-killing guide obeyed at once.  Quickly under his feet he fastened the supple sandals,  ever-glowing gold, that wing him over the waves  and boundless earth with the rush of gusting winds.  He seized the wand that enchants the eyes of men  whenever Hermes wants, or wakes us up from sleep.  That wand in his grip, the powerful giant-killer,  swooping down from Pieria, down the high clear air,  plunged to the sea and skimmed the waves like a tern  that down the deadly gulfs of the barren salt swells  glides and dives for fish,  dipping its beating wings in bursts of spray &mdash;  so Hermes skimmed the crests on endless crests.  But once he gained that island worlds apart,  up from the deep-blue sea he climbed to dry land  and strode on till he reached the spacious cave  where the nymph with lovely braids had made her home,  and he found her there inside ... </p>

<p>A great fire </p>

<p>blazed on the hearth and the smell of cedar  cleanly split and sweetwood burning bright  wafted a cloud of fragrance down the island.  Deep inside she sang, the goddess Calypso, lifting  her breathtaking voice as she glided back and forth  before her loom, her golden shuttle weaving.  Thick, luxuriant woods grew round the cave,  alders and black poplars, pungent cypress too,  and there birds roosted, folding their long wings,  owls and hawks and the spread-beaked ravens of the sea,  black skimmers who make their living off the waves.  And round the mouth of the cavern trailed a vine  laden with clusters, bursting with ripe grapes.  Four springs in a row, bubbling clear and cold,  running side-by -side, took channels left and right.  Soft meadows spreading round were starred with violets,  lush with beds of parsley. Why, even a deathless god  who came upon that place would gaze in wonder,  heart entranced with pleasure. Hermes the guide,  the mighty giant-killer, stood there, spellbound ... </p>

<p></p>

<p>But once he'd had his fill of marveling at it all </p>

<p>he briskly entered the deep vaulted cavern. </p>

<p>Calypso, lustrous goddess, knew him at once, </p>

<p>as soon as she saw his features face-to-face. </p>

<p>Immortals are never strangers to each other, </p>

<p>no matter how distant one may make her home. </p>

<p>But as for great Odysseus &mdash; </p>

<p>Hermes could not find him within the cave. </p>

<p>Off he sat on a headland, weeping there as always, </p>

<p>wrenching his heart with sobs and groans and anguish, </p>

<p>gazing out over the barren sea through blinding tears. </p>

<p>But Calypso, lustrous goddess, questioned Hermes, </p>

<p>seating him on a glistening, polished chair. </p>

<p>&quot;God of the golden wand, why have you come? </p>

<p>A beloved, honored friend, </p>

<p>but it's been so long, your visits much too rare. </p>

<p>Tell me what's on your mind. I'm eager to do it, </p>

<p>whatever I can do ... whatever can be done.&quot; </p>

<p>And the goddess drew a table up beside him,  heaped with ambrosia, mixed him deep-red nectar.  Hermes the guide and giant-killer ate and drank.  Once he had dined and fortified himself with food  he launched right in, replying to her questions:  &quot;As one god to another, you ask me why I've come.  I'll tell you the whole story, mince no words &mdash;  your wish is my command.  It was Zeus who made me come, no choice of mine.  Who would willingly roam across a salty waste so vast,  so endless? Think: no city of men in sight, and not a soul  to offer the gods a sacrifice and burn the fattest victims.  But there is no way, you know, for another god to thwart  the will of storming Zeus and make it come to nothing.  Zeus claims you keep beside you a most unlucky man,  most harried of all who fought for Priam's Troy  nine years, sacking the city in the tenth,  and then set sail for home. </p>

<p></p>

<p>But voyaging back they outraged Queen Athena </p>

<p>who loosed the gales and pounding seas against them. </p>

<p>There all the rest of his loyal shipmates died </p>

<p>but the wind drove him on, the current bore him here. </p>

<p>Now Zeus commands you to send him off with all good speed: </p>

<p>it is not his fate to die here, far from his own people. </p>

<p>Destiny still ordains that he shall see his loved ones, </p>

<p>reach his high-roofed house, his native land at last.&quot; </p>

<p>But lustrous Calypso shuddered at those words  and burst into a flight of indignation. &quot;Hard-hearted  you are, you gods! You unrivaled lords of jealousy &mdash;  scandalized when goddesses sleep with mortals,  openly, even when one has made the man her husband.  So when Dawn with her rose-red fingers took Orion,  you gods in your everlasting ease were horrified  till chaste Artemis throned in gold attacked him,  out on Delos, shot him to death with gentle shafts.  And so when Demeter the graceful one with lovely braids  gave way to her passion and made love with lasion,  bedding down in a furrow plowed three times &mdash;  Zeus got wind of it soon enough, I'd say,  and blasted the man to death with flashing bolts.  So now at last, you gods, you train your spite on me  for keeping a mortal man beside me. The man 1 saved,  riding astride his keel-board, all alone, when Zeus  with one hurl of a white-hot bolt had crushed  his racing warship down the wine-dark sea.  There all the rest of his loyal shipmates died  but the wind drove him on, the current bore him here.  And /welcomed him warmly, cherished him, even vowed  to make the man immortal, ageless, all his days ...  But since there is no way for another god to thwart  the will of storming Zeus and make it come to nothing,  let the man go &mdash; if the Almighty insists, commands &mdash;  and destroy himself on the barren salt sea!  I'll send him off, but not with any escort.  1 have no ships in reach, no crew to ply the oars  and send him scudding over the sea's broad back. </p>

<p></p>

<p>But I will gladly advise him &mdash; I'll hide nothing &mdash;  so he can reach his native country all unharmed.&quot; </p>

<p>And the guide and giant-killer reinforced her words:  &quot;Release him at once, just so. Steer clear of the rage of Zeus!  Or down the years he'll fume and make your life a hell.&quot; </p>

<p>With that the powerful giant-killer sped away.  The queenly nymph sought out the great Odysseus &mdash;  the commands of Zeus still ringing in her ears &mdash;  and found him there on the headland, sitting, still,  weeping, his eyes never dry, his sweet life flowing away  with the tears he wept for his foiled journey home,  since the nymph no longer pleased. In the nights, true,  he'd sleep with her in the arching cave &mdash; he had no choice &mdash;  unwilling lover alongside lover all too willing ...  But all his days he'd sit on the rocks and beaches,  wrenching his heart with sobs and groans and anguish,  gazing out over the barren sea through blinding tears.  So coming up to him now, the lustrous goddess ventured,  &quot;No need, my unlucky one, to grieve here any longer,  no, don't waste your life away. Now 1 am willing,  heart and soul, to send you off at last. Come,  take bronze tools, cut your lengthy timbers,  make them into a broad-beamed raft  and top it off with a half-deck high enough  to sweep you free and clear on the misty seas.  And 1 myself will stock her with food and water,  ruddy wine to your taste &mdash; all to stave off hunger &mdash;  give you clothing, send you a stiff following wind  so you can reach your native country all unharmed.  If only the ffods are willing. They rule the vaulting skies.  They're stronger than 1 to plan and drive things home.&quot; </p>

<p>Long-enduring Odysseus shuddered at that  and broke out in a sharp flight of protest.  &quot;Passage home? Never. Surely you're plotting  something else, goddess, urging me &mdash; in a raft &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>to cross the ocean's mighty gulfs. So vast, so full </p>

<p>of danger not even deep-sea ships can make it through, </p>

<p>swift as they are and buoyed up by the winds of Zeus himself. </p>

<p>1 won't set foot on a raft until you showgood faith, </p>

<p>until you consent to swear, goddess, a binding oath </p>

<p>you'll never plot some new intrigue to harm me!&quot; </p>

<p>He was so intense the lustrous goddess smiled,  stroked him with her hand, savored his name arid chided,  &quot;Ah what a wicked man you are, and never at a loss.  What a thing to imagine, what a thing to say!  Earth be my witness now, the vaulting Sky above  and the dark cascading waters of the Styx &mdash; 1 swear  by the greatest, grimmest oath that binds the happy gods;  1 will never plot some new intrigue to harm you-  Never. All 1 have in mind and devise for you  are the very plans I'd fashion for myself  if 1 were in your straits. My every impulse  bends to what is right. Not iron, trust me,  the heart within my breast. 1 am all compassion.&quot; </p>

<p>And lustrous Calypso quickly led the way  as he followed in the footsteps of the goddess.  They reached the arching cavern, man and god as one,  and Odysseus took the seat that Hermes just left,  while the nymph set out before him every kind  of food and drink that mortal men will take.  Calypso sat down face-to-face with the king  and the women served her nectar and ambrosia.  They reached out for the good things that lay at hand  and when they'd had their fill of food and drink  the lustrous one took up a new approach. &quot;So then,  royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, man of exploits,  still eager to leave at once and hurry back  to your own home, your beloved native land?  Good luck to you, even so. Farewell!  But if you only knew, down deep, what pains  are fated to fill your cup before you reach that shore. </p>

<p></p>

<p>you'd stay right here, preside in our house with me  and be immortal. Much as you long to see your wife,  the one you pine for all your days ... and yet  1 just might claim to be nothing less than she,  neither in face nor figure. Hardly right, is it,  for mortal woman to rival immortal goddess?  How, in build? in beauty?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ah great goddess,&quot;  worldly Odysseus answered, &quot;don't be angry with me,  please. All that you say is true, how well 1 know.  Look at my wise Penelope. She falls far short of you,  your beauty, stature. She is mortal after all  and you, you never age or die ...  Nevertheless 1 long &mdash; 1 pine, all my days &mdash;  to travel home and see the dawn of my return.  And if a god will wreck me yet again on the wine-dark sea,  1 can bear that too, with a spirit tempered to endure.  Much have 1 suffered, labored long and hard by now  in the waves and wars. Add this to the total &mdash;  bring the trial on!&quot; </p>

<p>Even as he spoke  the sun set and the darkness swept the earth.  And now, withdrawing into the cavern's deep recesses,  long in each other's arms they lost themselves in love. </p>

<p>When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more  Odysseus quickly dressed himself in cloak and shirt  while the nymph slipped on a loose, glistening robe,  filmy, a joy to the eye, and round her waist  she ran a brocaded golden belt  and over her head a scarf to shield her brow,  then turned to plan the great man's voyage home.  She gave him a heavy bronze ax that fit his grip,  both blades well-honed, with a fine olive haft  lashed firm to its head. She gave him a polished  smoothing-adze as well and then she led the way  to the island's outer edge where trees grew tall,  alders, black poplars and firs that shot sky-high. </p>

<p></p>

<p>seasoned, drying for years, ideal for easy floating. </p>

<p>Once she'd shown her guest where the tall timber stood, </p>

<p>Calypso the lustrous goddess headed home again. </p>

<p>He set to cutting trunks &mdash; the work was done in no time. </p>

<p>Twenty in all he felled, he trimmed them clean with his ax </p>

<p>and split them deftly, trued them straight to the line. </p>

<p>Meanwhile the radiant goddess brought him drills &mdash; </p>

<p>he bored through all his planks and wedged them snugly, </p>

<p>knocking them home together, locked with pegs and bolts. </p>

<p>Broad in the beam and bottom flat as a merchantman </p>

<p>when a master shipwright turns out her hull, </p>

<p>so broad the craft Odysseus made himself. </p>

<p>Working away at speed </p>

<p>he put up half -decks pinned to close-set ribs </p>

<p>and a sweep of gunwales rounded off the sides. </p>

<p>He fashioned the mast next and sank its yard in deep </p>

<p>and added a steering-oar to hold her right on course, </p>

<p>then he fenced her stem to stern with twigs and wicker, </p>

<p>bulwark against the sea-surge, floored with heaps of brush. </p>

<p>And lustrous Calypso came again, now with bolts of cloth </p>

<p>to make the sail, and he finished that off too, expertly. </p>

<p>Braces, sheets and brails &mdash; he rigged all fast on board, </p>

<p>then eased her down with levers into the sunlit sea. </p>

<p>That was the fourth day and all his work was done.  On the fifth, the lovely goddess launched him from her island,  once she had bathed and decked him out in fragrant clothes.  And Calypso stowed two skins aboard &mdash; dark wine in one,  the larger one held water &mdash; added a sack of rations,  filled with her choicest meats to build his strength,  and summoned a wind to bear him onward, fair and warm.  The wind lifting his spirits high, royal Odysseus  spread sail &mdash; gripping the tiller, seated astern &mdash;  and now the master mariner steered his craft,  sleep never closing his eyes, forever scanning  the stars, the Pleiades and the Plowman late to set  and the Great Bear that mankind also calls the Wagon:  she wheels on her axis always fixed, watching the Hunter, </p>

<p></p>

<p>and she alone is denied a plunge in the Ocean's baths.  Hers were the stars the lustrous goddess told him  to keep hard to port as he cut across the sea.  And seventeen days he sailed, making headway well;  on the eighteenth, shadowy mountains slowly loomed ...  the Phaeacians' island reaching toward him now,  over the misty breakers, rising like a shield. </p>

<p>But now Poseidon, god of the earthquake, saw him &mdash;  just returning home from his Ethiopian friends,  from miles away on the Solymi mountain-range  he spied Odysseus sailing down the sea  and it made his fury boil even more.  He shook his head and rumbled to himself,  &quot;Outrageous! Look how the gods have changed their minds  about Odysseus &mdash; while /was off with my Ethiopians.  Just look at him there, nearing Phaeacia's shores  where he's fated to escape his noose of pain  that's held him until now. Still my hopes ride high &mdash;  I'll give that man his swamping fill of trouble!&quot; </p>

<p>With that he rammed the clouds together &mdash; both hands  clutching his trident &mdash; churned the waves into chaos, whipping  all the gales from every quarter, shrouding over in thunderheads  the earth and sea at once &mdash; and night swept down from the sky &mdash;  East and South Winds clashed and the raging West and North,  sprung from the heavens, roiled heaving breakers up &mdash;  and Odysseus' knees quaked, his spirit too;  numb with fear he spoke to his own great heart:  &quot;Wretched man &mdash; ^what becomes of me now, at last?  1 fear the nymph foretold it all too well &mdash;  on the high seas, she said, before 1 can reach  my native land I'll fill my cup of pain! And now,  look, it all comes to pass. What monstrous clouds &mdash;  King Zeus crowning the whole wide heaven black &mdash;  churning the seas in chaos, gales blasting,  raging around my head from every quarter &mdash;  my death-plunge in a flash, it's certain now! </p>

<p></p>

<p>Three, four times blessed, my friends-in arms  who died on the plains of Troy those years ago,  serving the sons of Atreus to the end. Would to god  I'd died there too and met my fate that day the Trojans,  swarms of them, hurled at me^Niih bronze spears,  fighting over the corpse of proud Achilles!  A hero's funeral then, my glory spread by comrades &mdash;  now what a wretched death I'm doomed to die!&quot; </p>

<p>At that a massive wave came crashing down on his head,  a terrific onslaught spinning his craft round and round &mdash;  he was thrown clear of the decks &mdash; </p>

<p>the steering-oar wrenched </p>

<p>from his grasp &mdash; </p>

<p>and in one lightning attack the brawling  galewinds struck full-force, snapping the mast mid-shaft  and hurling the sail and sailyard far across the sea.  He went under a good long while, no fast way out,  no struggling up from under the giant wave's assault,  his clothing dragged him down &mdash; divine Calypso's gifts &mdash;  but at last he fought his way to the surface spewing  bitter brine, streams of it pouring down his head.  But half-drowned as he was, he'd not forget his craft &mdash;  he lunged after her through the breakers, laying hold  and huddling amidships, fled the stroke of death.  Pell-mell the rollers tossed her along down-current,  wild as the North Wind tossing thistle along the fields  at high harvest &mdash; dry stalks clutching each other tightly &mdash;  so the galewinds tumbled her down the sea, this way, that way,  now the South Wind flinging her over to North to sport with,  now the East Wind giving her up to West to harry on and on. </p>

<p>But someone saw him &mdash; Cadmus' daughter with lovely ankles,  Ino, a mortal woman once with human voice and called  Leucothea now she lives in the sea's salt depths,  esteemed by all the gods as she deserves.  She pitied Odysseus, tossed, tormented so &mdash;  she broke from the waves like a shearwater on the wing. </p>

<p></p>

<p>lit on the wreck and asked him kindly, &quot;Ah poor man, </p>

<p>why is the god of earthquakes so dead set against you? </p>

<p>Strewing your way with such a crop of troubles! </p>

<p>But he can't destroy you, not for all his anger. </p>

<p>Just do as 1 say. You seem no fool to me. </p>

<p>Strip off those clothes and leave your craft </p>

<p>for the winds to hurl, and swim for it now, you must, </p>

<p>strike out with your arms for landfall there, </p>

<p>Phaeacian land where destined safety waits. </p>

<p>Here, take this scarf, </p>

<p>tie it around your waist &mdash; it is immortal. </p>

<p>Nothing to fear now, neither pain nor death. </p>

<p>But once you grasp the mainland with your hands </p>

<p>untie it quickly, throw it into the wine-dark sea, </p>

<p>far from the shore, but you, you turn your head away!&quot; </p>

<p>With that the goddess handed him the scarf  and slipped back in the heavy breaking seas  like a shearwater once again &mdash;  and a dark heaving billow closed above her.  But battle-weary Odysseus weighed two courses,  deeply torn, probing his fighting spirit: &quot;Oh no &mdash;  1 fear another immortal weaves a snare to trap me,  urging me to abandon ship! 1 won't. Not yet.  That shore's too far away &mdash;  1 glimpsed it myself &mdash; ^where sAesays refuge waits.  No, here's what I'll do, it's what seems best to me.  As long as the timbers cling and joints stand fast,  I'll hold out aboard her and take a whipping &mdash;  once the breakers smash my craft to pieces,  then I'll swim &mdash; no better plan for now.&quot; </p>

<p>But just as great Odysseus thrashed things out,  Poseidon god of the earthquake launched a colossal wave,  terrible, murderous, arching over him, pounding down on him,  hard as a windstorm blasting piles of dry parched chaff,  scattering flying husks &mdash; so the long planks of his boat  were scattered far and wide. But Odysseus leapt aboard </p>

<p></p>

<p>one timber and riding it like a plunging racehorse </p>

<p>stripped away his clothes, divine Calypso's gifts, </p>

<p>and quickly tying the scarf around his waist </p>

<p>he dove headfirst in the sea, </p>

<p>stretched his arms and stroked for life itself. </p>

<p>But again the mighty god of earthquakes spied him, </p>

<p>shook his head and grumbled deep in his spirit, &quot;Go, go, </p>

<p>after all you've suffered &mdash; rove your miles of sea &mdash; </p>

<p>till you fall in the arms of people loved by Zeus. </p>

<p>Even so 1 can hardly think you'll find </p>

<p>your punishments too light!&quot; </p>

<p>With that threat  he lashed his team with their long flowing manes,  gaining Aegae port where his famous palace stands. </p>

<p>But Zeus's daughter Athena countered him at once.  The rest of the winds she stopped right in their tracks,  commanding them all to hush now, go to sleep.  All but the boisterous North &mdash; she whipped him up  and the goddess beat the breakers flat before Odysseus,  dear to Zeus, so he could reach the Phaeacians,  mingle with men who love their long oars  and escape his death at last. </p>

<p>Yes, but now,  adrift on the heaving swells two nights, two days &mdash;  quite lost &mdash; again and again the man foresaw his death.  Then when Dawn with her lovely locks brought on  the third day, the wind fell in an instant,  all glazed to a dead calm, and Odysseus,  scanning sharply, raised high by a groundswell,  looked up and saw it &mdash; landfall, just ahead.  Joy ... warm as the joy that children feel  when they see their father's life dawn again,  one who's lain on a sickbed racked with torment,  wasting away, slowly, under some angry power's onslaught &mdash;  then what joy when the gods deliver him from his pains!  So warm, Odysseus' joy when he saw that shore, those trees,  as he swam on, anxious to plant his feet on solid ground again. </p>

<p></p>

<p>But just offshore, as far as a man's shout can carry,  he caught the boom of a heavy surf on jagged reefs &mdash;  roaring breakers crashing down on an ironbound coast,  exploding in fury &mdash; </p>

<p>the whole sea shrouded &mdash; </p>

<p>sheets of spray &mdash;  no harbors to hold ships, no roadstead where they'd ride,  nothing but jutting headlands, riptooth reefs, cliffs.  Odysseus' knees quaked and the heart inside him sank;  he spoke to his fighting spirit, desperate: &quot;Worse and worse!  Now that Zeus has granted a glimpse of land beyond my hopes,  now I've crossed this waste of water, the end in sight,  there's no way out of the boiling surf &mdash; 1 see no way!  Rugged reefs offshore, around them breakers roaring,  above them a smooth rock face, rising steeply, look,  and the surge too deep inshore, no spot to stand  on my own two legs and battle free of death.  If 1 clamber out, some big comber will hoist me,  dash me against that cliff &mdash; my struggles all a waste!  If 1 keep on swimming down the coast, trying to find  a seabeach shelving against the waves, a sheltered cove &mdash;  1 dread it &mdash; another gale will snatch me up and haul me  back to the fish-infested sea, retching in despair.  Or a dark power will loose some monster at me,  rearing out of the waves &mdash; one of the thousands  Amphitrite's breakers teem with. Well 1 know  the famous god of earthquakes hates my very name!&quot; </p>

<p>Just as that fear went churning through his mind  a tremendous roller swept him toward the rocky coast  where he'd have been flayed alive, his bones crushed,  if the bright-eyed goddess Pallas had not inspired him now.  He lunged for a reef, he seized it with both hands and clung  for dear life, groaning until the giant wave surged past  and so he escaped its force, but the breaker's backwash  charged into him full fury and hurled him out to sea.  Like pebbles stuck in the suckers of some octopus  dragged from its lair &mdash; so strips of skin torn </p>

<p></p>

<p>from his clawing hands stuck to the rock face. </p>

<p>A heavy sea covered him over, then and there </p>

<p>unlucky Odysseus would have met his death &mdash; </p>

<p>against the will of Fate &mdash; </p>

<p>but the bright-eyed one inspired him yet again. </p>

<p>Fighting out from the breakers pounding toward the coast, </p>

<p>out of danger he swam on, scanning the land, trying to find </p>

<p>a seabeach shelving against the waves, a sheltered cove, </p>

<p>and stroking hard he came abreast of a river 's mouth, </p>

<p>running calmly, the perfect spot, he thought ... </p>

<p>free of rocks, with a windbreak from the gales. </p>

<p>As the current flowed he felt the river's god and </p>

<p>prayed to him in spirit: &quot;Hear me, lord, whoever you are, </p>

<p>I've come to you, the answer to all my prayers &mdash; </p>

<p>rescue me from the sea, the Sea-lord's curse! </p>

<p>Even immortal gods will show a man respect, </p>

<p>whatever wanderer seeks their help &mdash; like me &mdash; </p>

<p>1 throw myself on your mercy, on your current now &mdash; </p>

<p>1 have suffered greatly. Pity me, lord, </p>

<p>your suppliant cries for help!&quot; </p>

<p>So the man prayed  and the god stemmed his current, held his surge at once  and smoothing out the swells before Odysseus now,  drew him safe to shore at the river's mouth.  His knees buckled, massive arms fell limp,  the sea had beaten down his striving heart.  His whole body swollen, brine aplenty gushing  out of his mouth and nostrils &mdash; breathless, speechless,  there he lay, with only a little strength left in him,  deathly waves of exhaustion overwhelmed him now ...  But once he regained his breath and rallied back to life,  at last he loosed the goddess' scarf from his body,  dropped it into the river flowing out to sea  and a swift current bore it far downstream  and suddenly Ino caught it in her hands.  Struggling up from the banks, he flung himself  in the deep reeds, he kissed the good green earth  and addressed his fighting spirit, desperate still: </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Man of misery, what next? Is this the end? </p>

<p>If I wait out a long tense night by the banks, </p>

<p>I fear the sharp frost and the soaking dew together </p>

<p>will do me in &mdash; I'm bone-weary, about to breathe my last, </p>

<p>and a cold wind blows from a river on toward morning. </p>

<p>But what if I climb that slope, go for the dark woods </p>

<p>and bed down in the thick brush? What if I'm spared </p>

<p>the chill, fatigue, and a sweet sleep comes my way? </p>

<p>I fear wild beasts will drag me off as quarry.&quot; </p>

<p>But this was the better course, it struck him now.  He set out for the woods and not far from the water  found a grove with a clearing all around and crawled  beneath two bushy olives sprung from the same root,  one olive wild, the other well-bred stock.  No sodden gusty winds could ever pierce them,  nor could the sun's sharp rays invade their depths,  nor could a downpour drench them through and through,  so dense they grew together, tangling side-by-side.  Odysseus crept beneath them, scraping up at once  a good wide bed for himself with both hands.  A fine litter of dead leaves had drifted in,  enough to cover two men over, even three,  in the wildest kind of winter known to man.  Long-enduring great Odysseus, overjoyed at the sight,  bedded down in the midst and heaped the leaves around him.  As a man will bury his glowing brand in black ashes,  off on a lonely farmstead, no neighbors near,  to keep a spark alive &mdash; no need to kindle fire  from somewhere else &mdash; so great Odysseus buried  himself in leaves and Athena showered sleep  upon his eyes ... sleep in a swift wave  delivering him from all his pains and labors,  blessed sleep that sealed his eyes at last. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Book VI </p>

<p></p>

<p>The Princess and  the Stranger </p>

<p>So there he lay at rest, the storm-tossed great Odysseus,  borne down by his hard labors first and now deep sleep  as Athena traveled through the countryside  and reached the Phaeacians' city. Years ago  they lived in a land of spacious dancing-circles,  Hyperia, all too close to the overbearing Cyclops,  stronger, violent brutes who harried them without end.  So their godlike king, Nausithous, led the people off  in a vast migration, settled them in Scheria,  far from the men who toil on this earth &mdash;  he flung up walls around the city, built the houses,  raised the gods' temples and shared the land for plowing.  But his fate had long since forced him down to Death  and now Alcinous ruled, and the gods made him wise. </p>

<p></p>

<p>straight to his house the clear-eyed Pallas went, </p>

<p>full of plans for great Odysseus' journey home. </p>

<p>She made her way to the gaily painted room </p>

<p>where a young girl lay asleep ... </p>

<p>a match for the deathless gods in build and beauty, </p>

<p>Nausicaa, the daughter of generous King Alcinous. </p>

<p>Two handmaids fair as the Graces slept beside her, </p>

<p>flanking the two posts, with the gleaming doors closed. </p>

<p>But the goddess drifted through like a breath of fresh air, </p>

<p>rushed to the girl's bed and hovering close she spoke, </p>

<p>in face and form like the shipman Dymas' daughter, </p>

<p>a girl the princess' age, and dearest to her heart. </p>

<p>Disguised, the bright-eyed goddess chided, &quot;Nausicaa, </p>

<p>how could your mother bear a careless girl like you? </p>

<p>Look at your fine clothes, lying here neglected &mdash; </p>

<p>with your marriage not far off, </p>

<p>the day you should be decked in all your glory </p>

<p>and offer elegant dress to those who form your escort. </p>

<p>That's how a bride's good name goes out across the world </p>

<p>and it brings her father and queenly mother joy. Come, </p>

<p>let's go wash these clothes at the break of day &mdash; </p>

<p>I'll help you, lend a hand, and the work will fly! </p>

<p>You won't stay unwed long. The noblest men </p>

<p>in the country court you now, all Phaeacians </p>

<p>just like you, Phaeacia-born and raised. So come, </p>

<p>first thing in the morning press your kingly father </p>

<p>to harness the mules and wagon for you, all to carry </p>

<p>your sashes, dresses, glossy spreads for your bed. </p>

<p>It's so much nicer for you to ride than go on foot. </p>

<p>The washing-pools are just too far from town.&quot; </p>

<p>With that </p>

<p>the bright-eyed goddess sped away to Olympus, where,  they say, the gods' eternal mansion stands unmoved,  never rocked by galewinds, never drenched by rains,  nor do the drifting snows assail it, no, the clear air  stretches away without a cloud, and a great radiance  plays across that world where the blithe gods </p>

<p></p>

<p>live all their days in bliss. There Athena went,  once the bright-eyed one had urged the princess on. </p>

<p>Dawn soon rose on her splendid throne and woke  Nausicaa finely gowned. Still beguiled by her dream,  down she went through the house to tell her parents now,  her beloved father and mother. She found them both inside.  Her mother sat at the hearth with several waiting- women,  spinning yarn on a spindle, lustrous sea-blue wool.  Her father she met as he left to join the lords  at a council island nobles asked him to attend.  She stepped up close to him, confiding, &quot;Daddy dear,  1 wonder, won't you have them harness a wagon for me,  the tall one with the good smooth wheels ... so 1  can take our clothes to the river for a washing?  Lovely things, but lying before me all soiled.  And you yourself, sitting among the princes,  debating points at your council,  you really should be wearing spotless linen.  Then you have five sons, full-grown in the palace,  two of them married, but three are lusty bachelors  always demanding crisp shirts fresh from the wash  when they go out to dance. Look at my duties &mdash;  that all rests on me. &quot; </p>

<p>So she coaxed, too shy  to touch on her hopes for marriage, young warm hopes,  in her father's presence. But he saw through it all  and answered quickly, &quot;1 won't deny you the mules,  my darling girl ... 1 won't deny you anything.  Off you go, and the men will harness a wagon,  the tall one with the good smooth wheels,  fitted out with a cradle on the top.&quot; </p>

<p>With that </p>

<p>he called to the stablemen and they complied.  They trundled the wagon out now, rolling smoothly,  backed the mule-team into the traces, hitched them up,  while the princess brought her finery from the room </p>

<p></p>

<p>and piled it into the wagon's polished cradle.  Her mother packed a hamper &mdash; treats of all kinds,  favorite things to refresh her daughter's spirits &mdash;  poured wine in a skin, and as Nausicaa climbed aboard,  the queen gave her a golden flask of suppling olive oil  for her and her maids to smooth on after bathing.  Then, taking the whip in hand and glistening reins,  she touched the mules to a start and out they clattered,  trotting on at a clip, bearing the princess and her clothes  and not alone: her maids went with her, stepping briskly too. </p>

<p>Once they reached the banks of the river flowing strong  where the pools would never fail, with plenty of water  cool and clear, bubbling up and rushing through  to scour the darkest stains &mdash; they loosed the mules,  out from under the wagon yoke, and chased them down  the river's rippling banks to graze on luscious clover.  Down from the cradle they lifted clothes by the armload,  plunged them into the dark pools and stamped them down  in the hollows, one girl racing the next to finish first  until they'd scoured and rinsed off all the grime,  then they spread them out in a line along the beach  where the surf had washed a pebbly scree ashore.  And once they'd bathed and smoothed their skin with oil,  they took their picnic, sitting along the river's banks  and waiting for all the clothes to dry in the hot noon sun.  Now fed to their hearts' content, the princess and her retinue  threw their veils to the wind, struck up a game of ball.  White-armed Nausicaa led their singing, dancing beat ...  as lithe as Artemis with her arrows striding down  from a high peak &mdash; ^Taygetus' towering ridge or Erymanthus &mdash;  thrilled to race with the wild boar or bounding deer,  and nymphs of the hills race with her,  daughters of Zeus whose shield is storm and thunder,  ranging the hills in sport, and Leto's heart exults  as head and shoulders over the rest her daughter rises,  unmistakable &mdash; she outshines them all, though all are lovely.  So Nausicaa shone among her maids, a virgin, still unwed. </p>

<p></p>

<p>But now, as she was about to fold her clothes  and yoke the mules and turn for home again,  now clear-eyed Pallas thought of what came next,  to make Odysseus wake and see this young beauty  and she would lead him to the Phaeacians' town.  The ball&mdash; </p>

<p>the princess suddenly tossed it to a maid  but it missed the girl, splashed in a deep swirling pool  and they all shouted out &mdash; </p>

<p>and that woke great Odysseus.  He sat up with a start, puzzling, his heart pounding:  &quot;Man of misery, whose land have 1 lit on now?  What arethey here &mdash; violent, savage, lawless?  or friendly to strangers, god-fearing men?  Listen: shouting, echoing round me &mdash; ^women, girls &mdash;  or the nymphs who haunt the rugged mountaintops  and the river springs and meadows lush with grass!  Or am 1 really close to people who speak my language?  Up with you, see how the land lies, see for yourself now ...&quot; </p>

<p>Muttering so, great Odysseus crept out of the bushes,  stripping off with his massive hand a leafy branch  from the tangled olive growth to shield his body,  hide his private parts. And out he stalked  as a mountain lion exultant in his power  strides through wind and rain and his eyes blaze  and he charges sheep or oxen or chases wild deer  but his hunger drives him on to go for flocks,  even to raid the best-defended homestead.  So Odysseus moved out ...  about to mingle with all those lovely girls,  naked now as he was, for the need drove him on,  a terrible sight, all crusted, caked with brine &mdash;  they scattered in panic down the jutting beaches.  Only Alcinous' daughter held fast, for Athena planted  courage within her heart, dissolved the trembling in her limbs,  and she firmly stood her ground and faced Odysseus, torn now &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>Should he fling his arms around her knees, the young beauty, </p>

<p>plead for help, or stand back, plead with a winning word, </p>

<p>beg her to lead him to the town and lend him clothing? </p>

<p>This was the better way, he thought. Plead now </p>

<p>with a subtle, winning word and stand well back, </p>

<p>don't clasp her knees, the girl might bridle, yes. </p>

<p>He launched in at once, endearing, sly and suave: </p>

<p>&quot;Here 1 am at your mercy, princess &mdash; </p>

<p>are you a goddess or a mortal? If one of the gods </p>

<p>who rule the skies up there, you're Artemis to the life, </p>

<p>the daughter of mighty Zeus &mdash; 1 see her now&mdash; just look </p>

<p>at your build, your bearing, your lithe flowing grace ... </p>

<p>But if you're one of the mortals living here on earth, </p>

<p>three times blest are your father, your queenly mother, </p>

<p>three times over your brothers too. How often their hearts </p>

<p>must warm with joy to see you striding into the dances &mdash; </p>

<p>such a bloom of beauty. True, but lie is the one </p>

<p>more blest than all other men alive, that man </p>

<p>who sways you with gifts and leads you home, his bride! </p>

<p>1 have never laid eyes on anyone like you, </p>

<p>neither man nor woman ... </p>

<p>1 look at you and a sense of wonder takes me. </p>

<p>Wait, </p>

<p>once 1 saw the like &mdash; in Delos, beside Apollo's altar &mdash;  the young slip of a palm-tree springing into the light.  There I'd sailed, you see, with a great army in my wake,  out on the long campaign that doomed my life to hardship.  That vision! Just as 1 stood there gazing, rapt, for hours ...  no shaft like that had ever risen up from the earth &mdash;  so now 1 marvel at you, my lady: rapt, enthralled,  too struck with awe to grasp you by the knees  though pain has ground me down. </p>

<p>Only yesterday, </p>

<p>the twentieth day, did 1 escape the wine-dark sea.  Till then the waves and the rushing gales had swept me on  from the island of Ogygia. Now some power has tossed me here,  doubtless to suffer still more torments on your shores. </p>

<p></p>

<p>I can't believe they 'll stop. Long before that  the gods will give me more, still more. </p>

<p>Compassion &mdash;  princess, please! You, after all that 1 have suffered,  you are the first I've come to. 1 know no one else,  none in your city, no one in your land.  Show me the way to town, give me a rag for cover,  just some cloth, some wrapper you carried with you here.  And may the good gods give you all your heart desires:  husband, and house, and lasting harmony too.  No finer, greater gift in the world than that ...  when man and woman possess their home, two minds,  two hearts that work as one. Despair to their enemies,  joy to all their friends. Their own best claim to glory. ' </p>

<p>&quot;Stranger,&quot; the white-armed princess answered staunchly,  &quot;friend, you're hardly a wicked man, and no fool, I'd say &mdash;  it's Olympian Zeus himself who hands our fortunes out,  to each of us in turn, to the good and bad,  however Zeus prefers ... </p>

<p>He gave you pain, it seems. You simply have to bear it.  But now, seeing you've reached our city and our land,  you'll never lack for clothing or any other gift,  the right of worn-out suppliants come our way.  I'll show you our town, tell you our people's name.  Phaeacians we are, who hold this city and this land,  and 1 am the daughter of generous King Alcinous.  All our people's power stems from him.&quot; </p>

<p>She called out to her girls with lovely braids:  &quot;Stop, my friends! Why run when you see a man?  Surely you don't think him an enemy, do you?  There's no one alive, there never will be one,  who'd reach Phaeacian soil and lay it waste.  The immortals love us far too much for that.  We live too far apart, out in the surging sea,  off at the world's end &mdash;  no other mortals come to mingle with us. </p>

<p></p>

<p>But here's an unlucky wanderer strayed our way </p>

<p>and we must tend him well. Every stranger and beggar </p>

<p>comes from Zeus, and whatever scrap we give him </p>

<p>he'll be glad to get. So, quick, my girls, </p>

<p>give our newfound friend some food and drink </p>

<p>and bathe the man in the river, </p>

<p>wherever you find some shelter from the wind.&quot; </p>

<p>At that </p>

<p>they came to a halt and teased each other on </p>

<p>and led Odysseus down to a sheltered spot </p>

<p>where he could find a seat, </p>

<p>just as great Alcinous' daughter told them. </p>

<p>They laid out cloak and shirt for him to wear, </p>

<p>they gave him the golden flask of suppling olive oil </p>

<p>and pressed him to bathe himself in the river's stream. </p>

<p>Then thoughtful Odysseus reassured the handmaids, </p>

<p>&quot;Stand where you are, dear girls, a good way off, </p>

<p>so 1 can rinse the brine from my shoulders now </p>

<p>and rub myself with oil ... </p>

<p>how long it's been since oil touched my skin! </p>

<p>But 1 won't bathe in front of you. 1 would be embarrassed &mdash; </p>

<p>stark naked before young girls with lovely braids.&quot; </p>

<p>The handmaids scurried off to tell their mistress.  Great Odysseus bathed in the river, scrubbed his body  clean of brine that clung to his back and broad shoulders,  scoured away the brackish scurf that caked his head.  And then, once he had bathed all over, rubbed in oil  and donned the clothes the virgin princess gave him,  Zeus's daughter Athena made him taller to all eyes,  his build more massive now, and down from his brow  she ran his curls like thick hyacinth clusters  full of blooms. As a master craftsman washes  gold over beaten silver &mdash; a man the god of fire  and Queen Athena trained in every fine technique &mdash;  and finishes off his latest effort, handsome work,  so she lavished splendor over his head and shoulders now.  And down to the beach he walked and sat apart. </p>

<p></p>

<p>glistening in his glory, breathtaking, yes, </p>

<p>and the princess gazed in wonder ... </p>

<p>then turned to her maids with lovely braided hair: </p>

<p>&quot;Listen, my white-armed girls, to what 1 tell you. </p>

<p>The gods of Olympus can't be all against this man </p>

<p>who's come to mingle among our noble people. </p>

<p>At first he seemed appalling, 1 must say &mdash; </p>

<p>now he seems like a god who rules the skies up there! </p>

<p>Ah, if only a man like tJlat^Nere called my husband, </p>

<p>lived right here, pleased to stay forever ... </p>

<p>Enough. </p>

<p>Give the stranger food and drink, my girls.&quot; </p>

<p>They hung on her words and did her will at once,  set before Odysseus food and drink, and he ate and drank,  the great Odysseus, long deprived, so ravenous now &mdash;  it seemed like years since he had tasted food. </p>

<p>The white-armed princess thought of one last thing.  Folding the clothes, she packed them into her painted wagon,  hitched the sharp-hoofed mules, and climbing up herself,  Nausicaa urged Odysseus, warmly urged her guest,  &quot;Up with you now, my friend, and off to town we go.  I'll see you into my wise father's palace where,  1 promise you, you'll meet all the best Phaeacians.  Wait, let's do it this way. You seem no fool to me.  While we're passing along the fields and plowlands,  you follow the mules and wagon, stepping briskly  with all my maids. I'll lead the way myself.  But once we reach our city, ringed by walls  and strong high towers too, with a fine harbor either side ...  and the causeway in is narrow; along the road the rolling ships  are all hauled up, with a slipway cleared for every vessel.  There's our assembly, round Poseidon's royal precinct,  built of quarried slabs planted deep in the earth.  Here the sailors tend their black ships' tackle,  cables and sails, and plane their oarblades down.  Phaeacians, you see, care nothing for bow or quiver. </p>

<p></p>

<p>only for masts and oars and good trim ships themselves &mdash; </p>

<p>we glory in our ships, crossing the foaming seas! </p>

<p>But 1 shrink from all our sea-dogs' nasty gossip. </p>

<p>Some old salt might mock us behind our backs &mdash; </p>

<p>we have our share of insolent types in town </p>

<p>and one of the coarser sort, spying us, might say, </p>

<p>'Now who's that tall, handsome stranger Nausicaa has in tow? </p>

<p>Where'd she light on himPHer husband-to-be, just wait! </p>

<p>But who &mdash; some shipwrecked stray she's taken up with, </p>

<p>some alien from abroad? Since nobody lives nearby. </p>

<p>Unless it's really a god come down from the blue </p>

<p>to answer all her prayers, and to have her all his days. </p>

<p>Good riddance! Let the girl go roving to find herself </p>

<p>a man from foreign parts. She only spurns her own &mdash; </p>

<p>countless Phaeacians round about who court her, </p>

<p>nothing but our best. ' </p>

<p>So they'll scoff...  just think of the scandal that would face me then.  I'd find fault with a girl who carried on that way,  flouting her parents' wishes &mdash; father, mother, still alive &mdash;  consorting with men before she'd tied the knot in public.  No, stranger, listen closely to what 1 say, the sooner  to win your swift voyage home at my father's hands.  Now, you'll find a splendid grove along the road &mdash;  poplars, sacred to Pallas &mdash; </p>

<p>a bubbling spring's inside and meadows run around it.  There lies my father's estate, his blooming orchard too,  as far from town as a man's strong shout can carry.  Take a seat there, wait a while, and give us time  to make it into town and reach my father's house.  Then, when you think we're home, walk on yourself  to the city, ask the way to my father's palace,  generous King Alcinous. You cannot miss it,  even an innocent child could guide you there.  No other Phaeacian's house is built like that:  so grand, the palace of Alcinous, our great hero.  Once the mansion and courtyard have enclosed you, go,  quickly, across the hall until you reach my mother. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Beside the hearth she sits in the fire's glare, </p>

<p>spinning yarn on a spindle, sea-blue wool &mdash; </p>

<p>a stirring sight, you'll see ... </p>

<p>she leans against a pillar, her ladies sit behind. </p>

<p>And my father's throne is drawn up close beside her; </p>

<p>there he sits and takes his wine, a mortal like a god. </p>

<p>Go past him, grasp my mother's knees &mdash; if you want </p>

<p>to see the day of your return, rejoicing, soon, </p>

<p>even if your home's a world away. </p>

<p>If only the queen will take you to her heart, </p>

<p>then there's hope that you will see your loved ones, </p>

<p>reach your own grand house, your native land at last.&quot; </p>

<p>At that she touched the mules with her shining whip  and they quickly left the running stream behind.  The team trotted on, their hoofs wove in and out.  She drove them back with care so all the rest,  maids and Odysseus, could keep the pace on foot,  and she used the whip discreetly.  The sun sank as they reached the hallowed grove,  sacred to Athena, where Odysseus stopped and sat  and said a prayer at once to mighty Zeus's daughter:  &quot;Hear me, daughter of Zeus whose shield is thunder &mdash;  tireless one, Athena! Now hear my prayer at last,  for you never heard me then, when 1 was shattered,  when the famous god of earthquakes wrecked my craft.  Grant that here among the Phaeacian people  1 may find some mercy and some love!&quot; </p>

<p>So he prayed and Athena heard his prayer  but would not yet appear to him undisguised.  She stood in awe of her Father's brother, lord of the sea  who still seethed on, still churning with rage against  the great Odysseus till he reached his native land. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Book VII </p>

<p></p>

<p>Phaeacia's Halls  and Gardens </p>

<p></p>

<p>Now as Odysseus, long an exile, prayed in Athena's grove, </p>

<p>the hardy mule-team drew the princess toward the city. </p>

<p>Reaching her father's splendid halls, she reined in, </p>

<p>just at the gates &mdash; her brothers clustering round her, </p>

<p>men like gods, released the mules from the yoke </p>

<p>and brought the clothes indoors </p>

<p>as Nausicaa made her way toward her bedroom. </p>

<p>There her chambermaid lit a fire for her &mdash; </p>

<p>Eury medusa, the old woman who'd come from Apiraea </p>

<p>years ago, when the rolling ships had sailed her in </p>

<p>and the country picked her out as King Alcinous' prize, </p>

<p>for he ruled all the Phaeacians, they obeyed him like a god. </p>

<p>Once, she had nursed the white-armed princess in the palace. </p>

<p>Now she lit a fire and made her supper in the room. </p>

<p></p>

<p>At the same time, Odysseus set off toward the city.  Pallas Athena, harboring kindness for the hero,  drifted a heavy mist around him, shielding him  from any swaggering islander who'd cross his path,  provoke him with taunts and search out who he was.  Instead, as he was about to enter the welcome city,  the bright-eyed goddess herself came up to greet him there,  for all the world like a young girl, holding a pitcher,  standing face-to-face with the visitor, who asked,  &quot;Little girl, now wouldn't you be my guide  to the palace of the one they call Alcinous?  The king who rules the people of these parts.  1 am a stranger, you see, weighed down with troubles,  come this way from a distant, far-off shore.  So 1 know no one here, none at all  in your city and the farmlands round about. &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Oh yes, sir, </p>

<p>good old stranger,&quot; the bright-eyed goddess said,  &quot;I'll show you the very palace that you're after &mdash;  the king lives right beside my noble father.  Come, quietly too, and 1 will lead the way.  Now not a glance at anyone, not a question.  The men here never suffer strangers gladly,  have no love for hosting a man from foreign lands.  All they really trust are their fast, flying ships  that cross the mighty ocean. Gifts of Poseidon,  ah what ships they are &mdash;  quick as a bird, quick as a darting thought!&quot; </p>

<p>And Pallas Athena sped away in the lead  as he followed in her footsteps, man and goddess.  But the famed Phaeacian sailors never saw him,  right in their midst, striding down their streets.  Athena the one with lovely braids would not permit it,  the awesome goddess poured an enchanted mist around him,  harboring kindness for Odysseus in her heart.  And he marveled now at the balanced ships and havens, </p>

<p></p>

<p>the meeting grounds of the great lords and the long ramparts  looming, coped and crowned with palisades of stakes &mdash;  an amazing sight to see ... </p>

<p>And once they reached the king's resplendent halls </p>

<p>the bright-eyed goddess cried out, &quot;Good old stranger, </p>

<p>here, here is the very palace that you're after &mdash; </p>

<p>I've pointed you all the way. Here you'll find </p>

<p>our princes dear to the gods, busy feasting. </p>

<p>You go on inside. Be bold, nothing to fear. </p>

<p>In every venture the bold man comes off best, </p>

<p>even the wanderer, bound from distant shores. </p>

<p>The queen is the first you'll light on in the halls. </p>

<p>Arete, she is called, and earns the name: </p>

<p>she answers all our prayers. She comes, in fact, </p>

<p>from the same stock that bred our King Alcinous. </p>

<p>First came Nausithous, son of the earthquake god </p>

<p>Poseidon and Periboea, the lovely, matchless beauty, </p>

<p>the youngest daughter of iron- willed Eurymedon, </p>

<p>king of the overweening Giants years ago. </p>

<p>He led that reckless clan to its own ruin, </p>

<p>killed himself in the bargain, but the Sea-lord </p>

<p>lay in love with Periboea and she produced a son, </p>

<p>Nausithous, that lionheart who ruled Phaeacia well. </p>

<p>Now, Nausithous had two sons, Rhexenor and Alcinous, </p>

<p>but the lord of the silver bow, Apollo, shot Rhexenor down &mdash; </p>

<p>married, true, yet still without a son in the halls, </p>

<p>he left one child behind, a daughter named Arete. </p>

<p>Alcinous made the girl his wife and honors her </p>

<p>as no woman is honored on this earth, of all the wives </p>

<p>now keeping households under their husbands' sway. </p>

<p>Such is her pride of place, and always will be so: </p>

<p>dear to her loving children, to Alcinous himself </p>

<p>and all our people. They gaze on Jier as a god, </p>

<p>saluting her warmly on her walks through town. </p>

<p>She lacks nothing in good sense and judgment &mdash; </p>

<p>she can dissolve quarrels, even among men, </p>

<p>whoever wins her sympathies. </p>

<p></p>

<p>If only our queen will take you to her heart, </p>

<p>then there's hope that you will see your loved ones, </p>

<p>reach your high-roofed house, your native land at last.&quot; </p>

<p>And with that vow the bright-eyed goddess sped away,  over the barren sea, leaving welcome Scheria far behind,  and reaching Marathon and the spacious streets of Athens,  entered Erechtheus' sturdy halls, Athena's stronghold.  Now as Odysseus approached Alcinous' famous house  a rush of feelings stirred within his heart,  bringing him to a standstill,  even before he crossed the bronze threshold ...  A radiance strong as the moon or rising sun came flooding  through the high-roofed halls of generous King Alcinous.  Walls plated in bronze, crowned with a circling frieze  glazed as blue as lapis, ran to left and right  from outer gates to the deepest court recess.  Solid golden doors enclosed the palace.  Up from the bronze threshold silver doorposts rose  with silver lintel above, and golden handle hooks.  And dogs of gold and silver were stationed either side,  forged by the god of fire with all his cunning craft  to keep watch on generous King Alcinous' palace now,  his immortal guard-dogs, ageless, all their days.  Inside to left and right, in a long unbroken row  from farthest outer gate to the inmost chamber,  thrones stood backed against the wall, each draped  with a finely spun brocade, women's handsome work.  Here the Phaeacian lords would sit enthroned,  dining, drinking &mdash; ^the feast flowed on forever.  And young boys, molded of gold, set on pedestals  standing firm, were lifting torches high in their hands  to flare through the nights and light the feasters down the hall.  And Alcinous has some fifty serving-women in his house:  some, turning the handmill, grind the apple-yellow grain,  some weave at their webs or sit and spin their yarn,  fingers flickering quick as aspen leaves in the wind  and the densely woven woolens dripping oil droplets. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Just as Phaeacian men excel the world at sailing,  driving their swift ships on the open seas,  so the women excel at all the arts of weaving.  That is Athena's gift to them beyond all others &mdash;  a genius for lovely work, and a fine mind too. </p>

<p>Outside the courtyard, fronting the high gates,  a magnificent orchard stretches four acres deep  with a strong fence running round it side-to-side.  Here luxuriant trees are always in their prime,  pomegranates and pears, and apples glowing red,  succulent figs and olives swelling sleek and dark.  And the yield of all these trees will never flag or die,  neither in winter nor in summer, a harvest all year round  for the West Wind always breathing through will bring  some fruits to the bud and others warm to ripeness &mdash;  pear mellowing ripe on pear, apple on apple,  cluster of grapes on cluster, fig crowding fig.  And here is a teeming vineyard planted for the kings,  beyond it an open level bank where the vintage grapes  lie baking to raisins in the sun while pickers gather others;  some they trample down in vats, and here in the front rows  bunches of unripe grapes have hardly shed their blooms  while others under the sunlight slowly darken purple.  And there by the last rows are beds of greens,  bordered and plotted, greens of every kind,  glistening fresh, year in, year out. And last,  there are two springs, one rippling in channels  over the whole orchard &mdash; ^the other, flanking it,  rushes under the palace gates  to bubble up in front of the lofty roofs  where the city people come and draw their water. </p>

<p>Such </p>

<p>the gifts, the glories showered down by the gods  on King Alcinous' realm. </p>

<p>And there Odysseus stood,  gazing at all this bounty, a man who'd borne so much ...  Once he'd had his fill of marveling at it all. </p>

<p></p>

<p>he crossed the threshold quickly,  strode inside the palace. Here he found  the Phaeacian lords and captains tipping out  libations now to the guide and giant-killer Hermes,  the god to whom they would always pour the final cup  before they sought their beds. Odysseus went on  striding down the hall, the man of many struggles  shrouded still in the mist Athena drifted round him,  till he reached Arete and Alcinous the king. And then,  the moment he flung his arms around Arete s knees,  the godsent mist rolled back to reveal the great man.  And silence seized the feasters all along the hall &mdash;  seeing him right before their eyes, they marveled,  gazing on him now as Odysseus pleaded, &quot;Queen,  Arete, daughter of godlike King Rhexenor!  Here after many trials 1 come to beg for mercy,  your husband's, yours, and all these feasters' here.  May the gods endow them with fortune all their lives,  may each hand down to his sons the riches in his house  and the pride of place the realm has granted him.  But as for myself, grant me a rapid convoy home  to my own native land. How far away I've been  from all my loved ones &mdash; how long 1 have suffered!&quot; </p>

<p>Pleading so, the man sank down in the ashes,  just at the hearth beside the blazing fire,  while all the rest stayed hushed, stock-still.  At last the old revered Echeneus broke the spell,  the eldest lord in Phaeacia, finest speaker too,  a past master at all the island's ancient ways.  Impelled by kindness now, he rose and said,  &quot;This is no way, Alcinous. How indecent, look,  our guest on the ground, in the ashes by the fire!  Your people are holding back, waiting for your signal.  Come, raise him up and seat the stranger now,  in a silver-studded chair,  and tell the heralds to mix more wine for all  so we can pour out cups to Zeus who loves the lightning. </p>

<p></p>

<p>champion of suppliants &mdash; suppliants' rights are sacred.  And let the housekeeper give our guest his supper,  unstinting with her stores.&quot; </p>

<p>Hearing that,  Alcinous, poised in all his majesty, took the hand  of the seasoned, worldly-wise Odysseus, raised him up  from the hearth and sat him down in a burnished chair,  displacing his own son, the courtly Lord Laodamas  who had sat beside him, the son he loved the most.  A maid brought water soon in a graceful golden pitcher  and over a silver basin tipped it out  so the guest might rinse his hands,  then pulled a gleaming table to his side.  A staid housekeeper brought on bread to serve him,  appetizers aplenty too, lavish with her bounty.  As long-suffering great Odysseus ate and drank,  the hallowed King Alcinous called his herald:  &quot;Come, Pontonous! Mix the wine in the bowl,  pour rounds to all our banqueters in the house  so we can pour out cups to Zeus who loves the lightning,  champion of suppliants &mdash; suppliants' rights are sacred.&quot; </p>

<p>At that Pontonous mixed the heady, honeyed wine  and tipped first drops for the god in every cup,  then poured full rounds for all. And once they'd poured  libations out and drunk to their hearts' content,  Alcinous rose and addressed his island people:  &quot;Hear me, lords and captains of Phaeacia,  hear what the heart inside me has to say.  Now, our feast finished, home you go to sleep.  But at dawn we call the elders in to full assembly,  host our guest in the palace, sacrifice to the gods  and then we turn our minds to his passage home,  so under our convoy our new friend can travel back  to his own land &mdash; no toil, no troubles &mdash; soon,  rejoicing, even if his home's a world away.  And on the way no pain or hardship suffered,  not till he sets foot on native ground again. </p>

<p></p>

<p>There in the future he must suffer all that Fate  and the overbearing Spinners spun out on his life line  the very day his mother gave him birth ... But if  he's one of the deathless powers, out of the blue,  the gods are working now in strange, new ways.  Always, up to now, they came to us face-to-face  whenever we'd give them grand, glorious sacrifices &mdash;  they always sat beside us here and shared our feasts.  Even when some lonely traveler meets them on the roads,  they never disguise themselves. We're too close kin for that,  close as the wild Giants are, the Cyclops too. &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Alcinous!&quot; </p>

<p>wary Odysseus countered, &quot;cross that thought from your mind. </p>

<p>I'm nothing like the immortal gods who rule the skies, </p>

<p>either in build or breeding. I'm just a mortal man. </p>

<p>Whom do you know most saddled down with sorrow? </p>

<p>They are the ones I'd equal, grief for grief. </p>

<p>And 1 could tell a tale of still more hardship, </p>

<p>all I've suffered, thanks to the gods' will. </p>

<p>But despite my misery, let me finish dinner. </p>

<p>The belly's a shameless dog, there's nothing worse. </p>

<p>Always insisting, pressing, it never lets us forget &mdash; </p>

<p>destroyed as 1 am, my heart racked with sadness, </p>

<p>sick with anguish, still it keeps demanding, </p>

<p>'Eat, drink!' It blots out all the memory </p>

<p>of my pain, commanding, 'Fill me up!' </p>

<p>But you, </p>

<p>at the first light of day, hurry, please, </p>

<p>to set your unlucky guest on his own home soil. </p>

<p>How much 1 have suffered ... Oh just let me see </p>

<p>my lands, my serving-men and the grand high-roofed house &mdash; </p>

<p>then 1 can die in peace.&quot; </p>

<p>All burst into applause,  urging passage home for their newfound friend,  his pleading rang so true. And once they 'd poured  libations out and drunk to their hearts' content,  each one made his way to rest in his own house. </p>

<p></p>

<p>But King Odysseus still remained at hall, </p>

<p>seated beside the royal Alcinous and Arete </p>

<p>as servants cleared the cups and plates away. </p>

<p>The white-armed Queen Arete took the lead; </p>

<p>she'd spotted the cape and shirt Odysseus wore, </p>

<p>fine clothes she'd made herself with all her women, </p>

<p>so now her words flew brusquely, sharply: &quot;Stranger, </p>

<p>I'll be the first to question you &mdash; myself. </p>

<p>Who are you? Where are you from? </p>

<p>Who gave you the clothes you're wearing now? </p>

<p>Didn't you say you reached us roving on the sea? &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;What hard labor, queen, &quot; the man of craft replied,  &quot;to tell you the story of my troubles start to finish.  The gods on high have given me my share. Still,  this much 1 will tell you ...  seeing you probe and press me so intently.  There is an island, Ogygia, lying far at sea,  where the daughter of Atlas, Calypso, has her home,  the seductive nymph with lovely braids &mdash; a danger too,  and no one, god or mortal, dares approach her there. But 1,  cursed as 1 am, some power brought me to her hearth,  alone, when Zeus with a white-hot bolt had crushed  my racing warship down the wine-dark sea.  There all the rest of my loyal shipmates died  but 1, locking my arms around my good ship's keel,  drifted along nine days. On the tenth, at dead of night,  the gods cast me up on Ogygia, Calypso's island,  home of the dangerous nymph with glossy braids,  and the goddess took me in in all her kindness,  welcomed me warmly, cherished me, even vowed  to make me immortal, ageless, all my days &mdash;  but she never won the heart inside me, never.  Seven endless years 1 remained there, always drenching  with my tears the immortal clothes Calypso gave me.  Then, at last, when the eighth came wheeling round,  she insisted that 1 sail &mdash; inspired by warnings sent </p>

<p></p>

<p>from Zeus, perhaps, or her own mind had changed. </p>

<p>She saw me on my way in a solid craft, </p>

<p>tight and trim, and gave me full provisions, </p>

<p>food and mellow wine, immortal clothes to wear </p>

<p>and summoned a wind to bear me onward, fair and warm. </p>

<p>And seventeen days 1 sailed, making headway well; </p>

<p>on the eighteenth, shadowy mountains slowly loomed ... </p>

<p>your land! My heart leapt up, unlucky as 1 am, </p>

<p>doomed to be comrade still to many hardships. </p>

<p>Many pains the god of earthquakes piled upon me, </p>

<p>loosing the winds against me, blocking passage through, </p>

<p>heaving up a terrific sea, beyond belief &mdash; nor did the whitecaps </p>

<p>let me cling to my craft, for all my desperate groaning. </p>

<p>No, the squalls shattered her stem to stern, but 1, </p>

<p>1 swam hard, 1 plowed my way through those dark gulfs </p>

<p>till at last the wind and current bore me to your shores. </p>

<p>But here, had 1 tried to land, the breakers would have hurled me, </p>

<p>smashed me against the jagged cliffs of that grim coast, </p>

<p>so 1 pulled away, swam back till 1 reached a river, </p>

<p>the perfect spot at last, or so it struck me, </p>

<p>free of rocks, with a windbreak from the gales. </p>

<p>So, fighting for life, 1 flung myself ashore </p>

<p>and the godsent, bracing night came on at once. </p>

<p>Clambering up from the river, big with Zeus's rains, </p>

<p>1 bedded down in the brush, my body heaped with leaves, </p>

<p>and a god poured down a boundless sleep upon me, yes, </p>

<p>and there in the leaves, exhausted, sick at heart, </p>

<p>1 slept the whole night through </p>

<p>and on to the break of day and on into high noon </p>

<p>and the sun was wheeling down when sweet sleep set me free. </p>

<p>And 1 looked up, and there were your daughter's maids </p>

<p>at play on the beach, and she, she moved among them </p>

<p>like a deathless goddess! 1 begged her for help </p>

<p>and not once did her sense of tact desert her; </p>

<p>she behaved as you'd never hope to find </p>

<p>in one so young, not in a random meeting &mdash; </p>

<p>time and again the youngsters prove so flighty. </p>

<p>Not she. She gave me food aplenty and shining wine. </p>

<p></p>

<p>a bath in the river too, and gave me all this clothing.  That's my whole story. Wrenching to tell, but true.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ah, but in one regard, my friend,&quot; the king replied,  &quot;her good sense missed the mark, this daughter of mine.  She never escorted you to our house with all her maids  but sAe^Nas the first you asked for care and shelter.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Your majesty,&quot; diplomatic Odysseus answered,  &quot;don't find fault with a flawless daughter now,  not for my sake, please.  She urged me herself to follow with her maids.  1 chose not to, fearing embarrassment in fact &mdash;  what if you took offense, seeing us both together?  Suspicious we are, we men who walk the earth.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Oh no, my friend,&quot; Alcinous stated flatly,  &quot;I'm hardly a man for reckless, idle anger.  Balance is best in all things.  Father Zeus, Athena and lord Apollo! if only &mdash;  seeing the man you are, seeing we think as one &mdash;  you could wed my daughter and be my son-in-law  and stay right here with us. I'd give you a house  and great wealth &mdash; if you chose to stay, that is.  No Phaeacian would hold you back by force.  The curse of Father Zeus on such a thing!  And about your convoy home, you rest assured:  1 have chosen the day and 1 decree it is tomorrow.  And all that voyage long you'll lie in a deep sleep  while my people sail you on through calm and gentle tides  till you reach your land and house, or any place you please.  True, even if landfall lies more distant than Euboea,  off at the edge of the world ...  So say our crews, at least, who saw it once,  that time they carried the gold-haired Rhadamanthys  out to visit Tity us, son of Mother Earth. Imagine,  there they sailed and back they came in the same day,  they finished the homeward run with no strain at all. </p>

<p></p>

<p>You'll see for yourself how far they top the best &mdash;  my ships and their young shipmates  tossing up the whitecaps with their oars!&quot; </p>

<p>So he vowed </p>

<p>and the Jong-enduring great Odysseus glowed with joy </p>

<p>and raised a prayer and called the god by name: </p>

<p>&quot;Father Zeus on high &mdash; </p>

<p>may the king fulfill his promises one and all! </p>

<p>Then his fame would ring through the fertile earth </p>

<p>and never die &mdash; and 1 should reach my native land at last!&quot; </p>

<p>And now as the two men exchanged their hopes,  the white-armed queen instructed her palace maids  to make a bed in the porch's shelter, lay down  some heavy purple throws for the bed itself,  and over it spread some blankets, thick woolly robes,  a warm covering laid on top. Torches in hand,  they left the hall and fell to work at once,  briskly prepared a good snug resting-place  and then returned to Odysseus, urged the guest,  &quot;Up, friend, time for sleep. Your bed is made.&quot;  How welcome the thought of sleep to that man now ...  So there after many trials Odysseus lay at rest  on a corded bed inside the echoing colonnade.  Alcinous slept in chambers deep in his lofty house  where the queen his wife arranged and shared their bed. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Book VIII </p>

<p></p>

<p>A Day for Songs  and Contests </p>

<p></p>

<p>when young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more </p>

<p>royal Alcinous, hallowed island king, rose from bed </p>

<p>and great Odysseus, raider of cities, rose too. </p>

<p>Poised in his majesty, Alcinous led the way </p>

<p>to Phaeacia's meeting grounds, built for all </p>

<p>beside the harbored ships. Both men sat down </p>

<p>on the polished stone benches side-by-side </p>

<p>as Athena started roaming up and down the town, </p>

<p>in build and voice the wise Alcinous' herald, </p>

<p>furthering plans for Odysseus' journey home, </p>

<p>and stopped beside each citizen, urged them all, </p>

<p>&quot;Come this way, you lords and captains of Phaeacia, </p>

<p>come to the meeting grounds and learn about the stranger! </p>

<p>A new arrival! Here at our wise king's palace now, </p>

<p>he's here from roving the ocean, driven far off course &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>he looks like a deathless god!&quot; </p>

<p>Rousing their zeal,  their curiosity, each and every man, and soon enough  the assembly seats were filled with people thronging,  gazing in wonder at the seasoned man of war ...  Over Odysseus' head and shoulders now  Athena lavished a marvelous splendor, yes,  making him taller, more massive to all eyes,  so Phaeacians might regard the man with kindness,  awe and respect as well, and he might win through  the many trials they 'd pose to test the hero's strength.  Once they'd grouped, crowding the meeting grounds,  Alcinous rose and addressed his island people:  &quot;Hear me, lords and captains of Phaeacia,  hear what the heart inside me has to say.  This stranger here, our guest &mdash;  1 don't know who he is, or whether he comes  from sunrise lands or the western lands of evening,  but he has come in his wanderings to my palace;  he pleads for passage, he begs we guarantee it.  So now, as in years gone by, let us press on  and grant him escort. No one, 1 tell you, no one  who comes to my house will languish long here,  heartsick for convoy home. </p>

<p>Come, my people!  Haul a black ship down to the bright sea,  rigged for her maiden voyage &mdash;  enlist a crew of fifty -two young sailors,  the best in town, who've proved their strength before.  Let all hands lash their oars to the thwarts then disembark,  come to my house and fall in for a banquet, quickly.  I'll lay on a princely feast for all. So then,  these are the orders 1 issue to our crews.  For the rest, you sceptered princes here,  you come to my royal halls so we can give  this stranger a hero's welcome in our palace &mdash;  no one here refuse. Call in the inspired bard  Demodocus. God has given the man the gift of song. </p>

<p></p>

<p>to him beyond all others, the power to please,  however the spirit stirs him on to sing.&quot; </p>

<p>With those commands Alcinous led the way  and a file of sceptered princes took his lead,  while the herald went to find the gifted bard.  And the fifty -two young sailors, duly chosen,  briskly following orders,  went down to the shore of the barren salt sea.  And once they reached the ship at the surf 's edge,  first they hauled the craft into deeper water,  stepped the mast amidships, canvas brailed,  they made oars fast in the leather oarlock straps,  moored her riding high on the swell, then disembarked  and made their way to wise Alcinous' high-roofed halls.  There colonnades and courts and rooms were overflowing  with crowds, a mounting host of people young and old.  The king slaughtered a dozen sheep to feed his guests,  eight boars with shining tusks and a pair of shambling oxen.  These they skinned and dressed, and then laid out a feast  to fill the heart with savor. </p>

<p>In came the herald now,  leading along the faithful bard the Muse adored  above all others, true, but her gifts were mixed  with good and evil both: she stripped him of sight  but gave the man the power of stirring, rapturous song.  Pontonous brought the bard a silver-studded chair,  right amid the feasters, leaning it up against  a central column &mdash; hung his high clear lyre  on a peg above his head and showed him how  to reach up with his hands and lift it down.  And the herald placed a table by his side  with a basket full of bread and cup of wine  for him to sip when his spirit craved refreshment.  All reached out for the good things that lay at hand  and when they 'd put aside desire for food and drink,  the Muse inspired the bard  to sing the famous deeds of fighting heroes &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>the song whose fame had reached the skies those days:  The Strife Between Odysseus and Achilles, Peleus' Son ...  how once at the gods' flowing feast the captains clashed  in a savage war of words, while Agamemnon, lord of armies,  rejoiced at heart that Achaea's bravest men were battling so.  For this was the victory sign that Apollo prophesied  at his shrine in Py tho when Agamemnon strode across  the rocky threshold, asking the oracle for advice &mdash;  the start of the tidal waves of ruin tumbling down  on Troy 's and Achaea's forces, both at once,  thanks to the will of Zeus who rules the world. </p>

<p>That was the song the famous harper sang  but Odysseus, clutching his flaring sea-blue cape  in both powerful hands, drew it over his head  and buried his handsome face,  ashamed his hosts might see him shedding tears.  Whenever the rapt bard would pause in the song,  he'd lift the cape from his head, wipe off his tears  and hoisting his double-handled cup, pour it out to the gods.  But soon as the bard would start again, impelled to sing  by Phaeacia's lords, who reveled in his tale,  again Odysseus hid his face and wept.  His weeping went unmarked by all the others;  only Alcinous, sitting close beside him,  noticed his guest's tears,  heard the groan in the man's labored breathing  and said at once to the master mariners around him,  &quot;Hear me, my lords and captains of Phaeacia!  By now we've had our fill of food well-shared  and the lyre too, our loyal friend at banquets.  Now out we go again and test ourselves in contests,  games of every kind &mdash; so our guest can tell his friends,  when he reaches home, how far we excel the world  at boxing, wrestling, jumping, speed of foot.&quot; </p>

<p>He forged ahead and the rest fell in behind.  The herald hung the ringing lyre back on its peg </p>

<p></p>

<p>and taking Demodocus by the hand, led him from the palace, </p>

<p>guiding him down the same path the island lords </p>

<p>had just pursued, keen to watch the contests. </p>

<p>They reached the meeting grounds </p>

<p>with throngs of people streaming in their trail </p>

<p>as a press of young champions rose for competition. </p>

<p>Topsail and Riptide rose, the helmsman Rowhard too </p>

<p>and Seaman and Sternman, Surf-at-the-Beach and Stroke-Oar, </p>

<p>Breaker and Bowsprit, Racing-the-Wind and Swing-Aboard </p>

<p>and Seagirt the son of Greatfleet, Shipwrightson </p>

<p>and the son of Launcher, Broadsea, rose up too, </p>

<p>a match for murderous Ares, death to men &mdash; </p>

<p>in looks and build the best of all Phaeacians </p>

<p>after gallant Laodamas, the Captain of the People. </p>

<p>Laodamas rose with two more sons of great Alcinous, </p>

<p>Halius bred to the sea and Cly toneus famed for ships. </p>

<p>And now the games began, the first event a footrace ... </p>

<p>They toed the line &mdash; </p>

<p>and broke flat out from the start  with a fast pack flying down the field in a whirl of dust  and Cly toneus the prince outstripped them all by far,  flashing ahead the length two mules will plow a furrow  before he turned for home, leaving the pack behind  and raced to reach the crowds. </p>

<p>Next the wrestling,  grueling sport. They grappled, locked, and Broadsea,  pinning the strongest champions, won the bouts.  Next, in the jumping. Seagirt leapt and beat the field.  In the discus Rowhard up and outhurled them all by far.  And the king's good son Laodamas boxed them to their knees.  When all had enjoyed the games to their hearts' content  Alcinous' son Laodamas spurred them: &quot;Come, my friends,  let's ask our guest if he knows the ropes of any sport.  He's no mean man, not with a build like that ...  Look at his thighs, his legs, and what a pair of arms &mdash;  his massive neck, his big, rippling strength!  Nor is he past his prime,  just beaten down by one too many blows. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Nothing worse than the sea, I always say,  to crush a man, the strongest man ahve. &quot; </p>

<p>And Broadsea put in quickly,  &quot;Well said, Laodamas, right to the point.  Go up to the fellow, challenge him yourself. &quot; </p>

<p>On that cue, the noble prince strode up  before Odysseus, front and center, asking,  &quot;Come, stranger, sir, won't you try your hand  at our contests now? If you have skill in any.  It's fit and proper for you to know your sports.  What greater glory attends a man, while he's alive,  than what he wins with his racing feet and striving hands?  Come and compete then, throw your cares to the wind!  It won't be long, your journey's not far off &mdash;  your ship's already hauled down to the sea,  your crew is set to sail.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Laodamas,&quot;  quick to the mark Odysseus countered sharply,  &quot;why do you taunt me so with such a challenge?  Pains weigh on my spirit now, not your sports &mdash;  I've suffered much already, struggled hard.  But here 1 sit amid your assembly still,  starved for passage home, begging your king,  begging all your people.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Oh 1 knew it!&quot;  Broadsea broke in, mocking him to his face.  &quot;1 never took you for someone skilled in games,  the kind that real men play throughout the world.  Not a chance. You're some skipper of profiteers,  roving the high seas in his scudding craft,  reckoning up his freight with a keen eye out  for home-cargo, grabbing the gold he can!  You're no athlete. 1 see that.&quot; </p>

<p>With a dark glance  wily Odysseus shot back, &quot;Indecent talk, my friend. </p>

<p></p>

<p>You, you're a reckless fool &mdash; 1 see that. So, </p>

<p>the gods don't hand out all their gifts at once, </p>

<p>not build and brains and flowing speech to all. </p>

<p>One man may fail to impress us with his looks </p>

<p>but a god can crown his words with beauty, charm, </p>

<p>and men look on with delight when he speaks out. </p>

<p>Never faltering, filled with winning self-control, </p>

<p>he shines forth at assembly grounds and people gaze </p>

<p>at him like a god when /?&pound;&bull; walks through the streets. </p>

<p>Another man may look like a deathless one on high </p>

<p>but there's not a bit of grace to crown his words. </p>

<p>Just like you, my fine, handsome friend. Not even </p>

<p>a god could improve those lovely looks of yours </p>

<p>but the mind inside is worthless. </p>

<p>Your slander fans the anger in my heart! </p>

<p>I'm no stranger to sports &mdash; for all your taunts &mdash; </p>

<p>I've held my place in the front ranks, 1 tell you, </p>

<p>long as 1 could trust to my youth and striving hands. </p>

<p>But now I'm wrestled down by pain and hardship, look, </p>

<p>I've borne my share of struggles, cleaving my way </p>

<p>through wars of men and pounding waves at sea. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, despite so many blows, </p>

<p>I'll give your games a whirl. Your insults </p>

<p>cut to the quick &mdash; you rouse my fighting blood!&quot; </p>

<p>Up he sprang, cloak and all, and seized a discus,  huge and heavy, more weighty by far than those  the Phaeacians used to hurl and test each other.  Wheeling round, he let loose with his great hand  and the stone whirred on &mdash; and down to ground they went,  those lords of the long oars and master mariners cringing  under the rock's onrush, soaring lightly out of his grip,  flying away past all the other marks, and Queen Athena,  built like a man, staked out the spot and cried  with a voice of triumph, &quot;Even a blind man,  friend, could find your mark by groping round &mdash;  it's not mixed up in the crowd, it's far in front! </p>

<p></p>

<p>There's nothing to fear in this event &mdash; </p>

<p>no one can touch you, much less beat your distance!&quot; </p>

<p>At that the heart of the long-suffering hero laughed,  so glad to find a ready friend in the crowd that,  lighter in mood, he challenged all Phaeacia's best:  &quot;Now go match that, you young pups, and straightaway  I'll hurl you another just as far, 1 swear, or even farther!  All the rest of you, anyone with the spine and spirit,  step right up and try me &mdash; you've incensed me so &mdash;  at boxing, wrestling, racing; nothing daunts me.  Any Phaeacian here except Laodamas himself.  The man's my host. Who would fight his friend?  He'd have to be good-for-nothing, senseless, yes,  to challenge his host and come to grips in games,  in a far-off land at that. He'd cut his own legs short.  But there are no others I'd deny or think beneath me &mdash;  I'll take on all contenders, gladly, test them head-to-head!  I'm not half bad in the world of games where men compete.  Well 1 know how to handle a fine polished bow,  the first to hit my man in a mass of enemies,  even with rows of comrades pressing near me,  taking aim with our shafts to hit our targets.  Philoctetes alone outshot me there at Troy  when ranks of Achaean archers bent their bows.  Of the rest I'd say that 1 outclass them all &mdash;  men still alive, who eat their bread on earth.  But I'd never vie with the men of days gone by,  not Heracles, not Eurytus of Oechalia &mdash; archers  who rivaled immortal powers with their bows.  That's why noble Eurytus died a sudden death:  no old age, creeping upon him in his halls ...  Apollo shot him down, enraged that the man  had challenged hJjn, the Archer God. </p>

<p>As for spears, </p>

<p>1 can fling a spear as far as the next man wings an arrow!  Only at sprinting 1 fear you'd leave me in the dust.  I've taken a shameful beating out on heavy seas. </p>

<p></p>

<p>no conditioning there on shipboard day by day.  My legs have lost their spring. &quot; </p>

<p>He finished. All stood silent, hushed.  Only Alcinous found a way to answer. &quot;Stranger,  friend &mdash; nothing you say among us seems ungracious.  You simply want to display the gifts you're born with,  stung that a youngster marched up to you in the games,  mocking, ridiculing your prowess as no one would  who had some sense of fit and proper speech.  But come now, hear me out,  so you can tell our story to other lords  as you sit and feast in your own halls someday,  your own wife and your children by your side,  remembering there our island prowess here:  what skills great Zeus has given us as well,  down all the years from our fathers' days till now.  We're hardly world-class boxers or wrestlers, 1 admit,  but we can race like the wind, we're champion sailors too,  and always dear to our hearts, the feast, the lyre and dance  and changes of fresh clothes, our warm baths and beds.  So come &mdash; all you Phaeacian masters of the dance &mdash;  now dance away! So our guest can tell his friends,  when he reaches home, how far we excel the world  in sailing, nimble footwork, dance and song. </p>

<p>Go, someone,  quickly, fetch Demodocus now his ringing lyre.  It must be hanging somewhere in the palace.&quot; </p>

<p>At the king's word the herald sprang to his feet  and ran to fetch the ringing lyre from the house.  And stewards rose, nine in all, picked from the realm  to set the stage for contests: masters-at-arms who  leveled the dancing-floor to make a fine broad ring.  The herald returned and placed the vibrant lyre now  in Demodocus' hands, and the bard moved toward the center,  flanked by boys in the flush of youth, skilled dancers  who stamped the ground with marvelous pulsing steps </p>

<p></p>

<p>as Odysseus gazed at their flying, flashing feet,  his heart aglow with wonder. </p>

<p>A rippling prelude &mdash;  now the bard struck up an irresistible song:  The Love of Ares and Aphrodite Crowned with flowers ...  how the two had first made love in Hephaestus' mansion,  all in secret. Ares had showered her with gifts  and showered Hephaestus' marriage bed with shame  but a messenger ran to tell the god of fire &mdash;  Helios, lord of the sun, who'd spied the couple  lost in each other 's arms and making love.  Hephaestus, hearing the heart- wounding story,  bustled toward his forge, brooding on his revenge &mdash;  planted the huge anvil on its block and beat out chains,  not to be slipped or broken, all to pin the lovers on the spot.  This snare the Firegod forged, ablaze with his rage at War,  then limped to the room where the bed of love stood firm  and round the posts he poured the chains in a sweeping net  with streams of others flowing down from the roofbeam,  gossamer-fine as spider webs no man could see,  not even a blissful god &mdash;  the Smith had forged a masterwork of guile.  Once he'd spun that cunning trap around his bed  he feigned a trip to the well-built town of Lemnos,  dearest to him by far of all the towns on earth.  But the god of battle kept no blind man's watch.  As soon as he saw the Master Craftsman leave  he plied his golden reins and arrived at once  and entered the famous god of fire's mansion,  chafing with lust for Aphrodite crowned with flowers.  She'd just returned from her father's palace, mighty Zeus,  and now she sat in her rooms as Ares strode right in  and grasped her hand with a warm, seductive urging:  &quot;Quick, my darling, come, let's go to bed  and lose ourselves in love! Your husband's away &mdash;  by now he must be off in the wilds of Lemnos,  consorting with his raucous Sintian friends. &quot; </p>

<p>So he pressed </p>

<p></p>

<p>and her heart raced with joy to sleep with War </p>

<p>and off they went to bed and down they lay &mdash; </p>

<p>and down around them came those cunning chains </p>

<p>of the crafty god of fire, showering down now </p>

<p>till the couple could not move a limb or lift a finger &mdash; </p>

<p>then they knew at last: there was no way out, not now. </p>

<p>But now the glorious crippled Smith was drawing near ... </p>

<p>he'd turned around, miles short of the Lemnos coast, </p>

<p>for the Sungod kept Azswatch and told Hephaestus all, </p>

<p>so back he rushed to his house, his heart consumed with anguish. </p>

<p>Halting there at the gates, seized with savage rage </p>

<p>he howled a terrible cry, imploring all the gods, </p>

<p>&quot;Father Zeus, look here &mdash; </p>

<p>the rest of you happy gods who live forever &mdash; </p>

<p>here is a sight to make you laugh, revolt you too! </p>

<p>Just because 1 am crippled, Zeus's daughter Aphrodite </p>

<p>will always spurn me and love that devastating Ares, </p>

<p>just because of his stunning looks and racer's legs </p>

<p>while 1 am a weakling, lame from birth, and who's to blame? </p>

<p>Both my parents &mdash; ^who else? If only they 'd never bred me! </p>

<p>Just look at the two lovers ... crawled inside my bed, </p>

<p>locked in each other's arms &mdash; ^the sight makes me burn! </p>

<p>But 1 doubt they'll want to lie that way much longer, </p>

<p>not a moment more &mdash; mad as they are for each other. </p>

<p>No, they'll soon tire of bedding down together, </p>

<p>but then my cunning chains will bind them fast </p>

<p>till our Father pays my bride-gifts back in full, </p>

<p>all 1 handed Jum for that shameless bitch his daughter, </p>

<p>irresistible beauty &mdash; all unbridled too!&quot; </p>

<p>So Hephaestus wailed  as the gods came crowding up to his bronze-floored house.  Poseidon god of the earthquake came, and Hermes came,  the running god of luck, and the Archer, lord Apollo,  while modesty kept each goddess to her mansion.  The immortals, givers of all good things, stood at the gates,  and uncontrollable laughter burst from the happy gods  when they saw the god of fire's subtle, cunning work.  One would glance at his neighbor, laughing out. </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;A bad day for adultery! Slow outstrips the Swift. &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Look how limping Hephaestus conquers War,  quickest of all the gods who rule Olympus!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The cripple wins by craft.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The adulterer, </p>

<p>Aewill pay the price!&quot; </p>

<p>So the gods would banter  among themselves but lord Apollo goaded Hermes on:  &quot;Tell me, Quicksilver, giver of all good things &mdash;  even with those unwieldy shackles wrapped around you,  how would you like to bed the golden Aphrodite?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Oh Apollo, if only!&quot; the giant-killer cried.  &quot;Archer, bind me down with triple those endless chains!  Let all you gods look on, and all you goddesses too &mdash;  how I'd love to bed that golden Aphrodite!&quot; </p>

<p>A peal of laughter broke from the deathless ones  but not Poseidon, not a smile from him; he kept on  begging the famous Smith to loose the god of war,  pleading, his words flying, &quot;Let him go!  1 guarantee you Ares will pay the price,  whatever you ask, Hephaestus,  whatever's right in the eyes of all the gods. &quot; </p>

<p>But the famous crippled Smith appealed in turn,  &quot;God of the earthquake, please don't urge this on me.  A pledge for a worthless man is a worthless pledge indeed.  What if he slips out of his chains &mdash; his debts as well?  How could 1 shackle youyNhile all the gods look on?&quot; </p>

<p>But the god of earthquakes reassured the Smith,  &quot;Look, Hephaestus, if Ares scuttles off and away,  squirming out of his debt, I'll pay the fine myself.&quot; </p>

<p>And the famous crippled Smith complied at last:  &quot;Now there's an offer 1 really can't refuse!&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>With all his force the god of fire loosed the chains  and the two lovers, free of the bonds that overwhelmed them so,  sprang up and away at once, and the Wargod sped to Thrace  while Love with her telltale laughter sped to Paphos,  Cyprus Isle, where her grove and scented altar stand.  There the Graces bathed and anointed her with oil,  ambrosial oil, the bloom that clings to the gods  who never die, and swathed her round in gowns  to stop the heart ... an ecstasy &mdash; a vision. </p>

<p>That was the song the famous harper sang  and Odysseus retished every note as the islanders,  the lords of the long oars and master mariners rejoiced. </p>

<p>Next the king asked Halius and Laodamas to dance,  the two alone, since none could match that pair.  So taking in hand a gleaming sea-blue ball,  made by the craftsman Poly bus &mdash; arching back,  one prince would hurl it toward the shadowy clouds  as the other leaping high into the air would catch it  quickly, nimbly, before his feet hit ground again.  Once they'd vied at throwing the ball straight up,  they tossed it back and forth in a blur of hands  as they danced across the earth that feeds us all,  while boys around the ring stamped out the beat  and a splendid rhythmic drumming sound arose,  and good Odysseus looked at his host, exclaiming,  &quot;King Alcinous, shining among your island people,  you boasted Phaeacia's dancers are the best &mdash;  they prove your point &mdash; 1 watch and I'm amazed!&quot; </p>

<p>His praises cheered the hallowed island king  who spoke at once to the master mariners around him:  &quot;Hear me, my lords and captains of Phaeacia,  our guest is a man of real taste, I'd say. Come,  let's give him the parting gifts a guest deserves.  There are twelve peers of the realm who rule our land,  thirteen, counting myself. Let each of us contribute </p>

<p></p>

<p>a fresh cloak and shirt and a bar of precious gold.  Gather the gifts together, hurry, so our guest  can have them all in hand when he goes to dine,  his spirit filled with joy.  As for Broadsea, let him make amends,  man-to-man, with his words as well as gifts.  His first remarks were hardly fit to hear. &quot; </p>

<p>All assented and gave their own commands,  each noble sent a page to fetch his gifts.  And Broadsea volunteered in turn, obliging:  &quot;Great Alcinous, shining among our island people,  of course I'll make amends to our newfound friend  as you request. I'll give the man this sword.  It's solid bronze and the hilt has silver studs,  the sheath around it ivory freshly carved.  Here's a gift our guest will value highly.&quot; </p>

<p>He placed the silver-studded sword in Odysseus' hands  with a burst of warm words: &quot;Farewell, stranger, sir &mdash;  if any remark of mine gave you offense,  may stormwinds snatch it up and sweep it off!  May the gods grant you safe passage home to see your wife &mdash;  you've been so far from loved ones, suffered so!&quot; </p>

<p>Tactful Odysseus answered him in kind:  &quot;And a warm farewell to you, too, my friend.  May the gods grant you good fortune &mdash;  may you never miss this sword, this gift you give  with such salutes. You've made amends in full.&quot; </p>

<p>With that </p>

<p>he slung the silver-studded sword across his shoulder.  As the sun sank, his glittering gifts arrived  and proud heralds bore them into the hall  where sons of King Alcinous took them over,  spread them out before their noble mother's feet &mdash;  a grand array of gifts. The king in all his majesty  led the rest of his peers inside, following in a file  and down they sat on rows of high-backed chairs. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The king turned to the queen and urged her, &quot;Come,  my dear, bring in an elegant chest, the best you have,  and lay inside it a fresh cloak and shirt, your own gifts.  Then heat a bronze cauldron over the fire, boil water,  so once our guest has bathed and reviewed his gifts &mdash;  all neatly stacked for sailing,  gifts our Phaeacian lords have brought him now &mdash;  he'll feast in peace and hear the harper's songs.  And 1 will give him this gorgeous golden cup of mine,  so he'll remember Alcinous all his days to come  when he pours libations out in his own house  to Father Zeus and the other gods on high-&quot; </p>

<p>And at that Arete told her serving-women,  &quot;Set a great three-legged cauldron over the fire &mdash;  do it right away!&quot; </p>

<p>And hoisting over the blaze  a cauldron, filling it brimful with bathing water,  they piled fresh logs beneath and lit them quickly.  The fire lapped at the vessel's belly, the water warmed.  Meanwhile the queen had a polished chest brought forth  from an inner room and laid the priceless gifts inside,  the clothes and gold the Phaeacian lords had brought,  and added her own gifts, a cloak and a fine shirt,  and gave her guest instructions quick and clear:  &quot;Now look to the lid yourself and bind it fast  with a good tight knot, so no one can rob you  on your voyage &mdash; drifting into a sweet sleep  as the black ship sails you home.&quot; </p>

<p>Hearing that,  the storm-tossed man secured the lid straightway,  he battened it fast with a swift, intricate knot  the lady Circe had taught him long ago.  And the housekeeper invited him at once  to climb into a waiting tub and bathe &mdash;  a hot, steaming bath ...  what a welcome sight to Odysseus' eyes! </p>

<p></p>

<p>He'd been a stranger to comforts such as these  since he left the lovely-haired Calypso's house,  yet all those years he enjoyed such comforts there,  never-ending, as if he were a god ... And now,  when maids had washed him, rubbed him down with oil  and drawn warm fleece and a shirt around his shoulders,  he stepped from the bath to join the nobles at their wine.  And there stood Nausicaa as he passed. Beside a column  that propped the sturdy roof she paused, endowed  by the gods with all her beauty, gazing at  Odysseus right before her eyes. Wonderstruck,  she hailed her guest with a winning flight of words:  &quot;Farewell, my friend! And when you are at home,  home in your own land, remember me at times.  Mainly to me you owe the gift of life.&quot; </p>

<p>Odysseus rose to the moment deftly, gently:  &quot;Nausicaa, daughter of generous King Alcinous,  may Zeus the Thunderer, Hera's husband, grant it so &mdash;  that 1 travel home and see the dawn of my return-  Even at home I'll pray to you as a deathless goddess  all my days to come. You saved my life, dear girl.&quot; </p>

<p>And he went and took his seat beside the king.  By now they were serving out the portions, mixing wine,  and the herald soon approached, leading the faithful bard  Demodocus, prized by all the people &mdash; seated him in a chair  amid the feasters, leaning it against a central column.  At once alert Odysseus carved a strip of loin,  rich and crisp with fat, from the white-tusked boar  that still had much meat left, and called the herald over:  &quot;Here, herald, take this choice cut to Demodocus  so he can eat his fill &mdash; ^with warm regards  from a man who knows what suffering is ...  From all who walk the earth our bards deserve  esteem and awe, for the Muse herself has taught them  paths of song. She loves the breed of harpers.&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>The herald placed the gift in Demodocus' hands  and the famous blind bard received it, overjoyed.  They reached for the good things that lay outspread  and when they 'd put aside desire for food and drink,  Odysseus, master of many exploits, praised the singer:  &quot;1 respect you, Demodocus, more than any man alive &mdash;  surely the Muse has taught you, Zeus's daughter,  or god Apollo himself. How true to life,  all too true ... you sing the Achaeans' fate,  all they did and suffered, all they soldiered through,  as if you were there yourself or heard from one who was.  But come now, shift your ground. Sing of the wooden horse  Epeus built with Athena's help, the cunning trap that  good Odysseus brought one day to the heights of Troy,  filled with fighting men who laid the city waste.  Sing thattoT me &mdash; true to life as it deserves &mdash;  and 1 will tell the world at once how freely  the Muse gave youXhe gods' own gift of song.&quot; </p>

<p>Stirred now by the Muse, the bard launched out  in a fine blaze of song, starting at just the point  where the main Achaean force, setting their camps afire,  had boarded the oarswept ships and sailed for home  but famed Odysseus' men already crouched in hiding &mdash;  in the heart of Troy's assembly &mdash; dark in that horse  the Trojans dragged themselves to the city heights.  Now it stood there, looming ...  and round its bulk the Trojans sat debating,  clashing, days on end. Three plans split their ranks:  either to hack open the hollow vault with ruthless bronze  or haul it up to the highest ridge and pitch it down the cliffs  or let it stand &mdash; a glorious offering made to pacify the gods &mdash;  and that, that final plan, was bound to win the day.  For Troy was fated to perish once the city lodged  inside her walls the monstrous wooden horse  where the prime of Argive power lag in wait  with death and slaughter bearing down on Troy. </p>

<p></p>

<p>And he sang how troops of Achaeans broke from cover,  streaming out of the horse's hollow flanks to plunder Troy &mdash;  he sang how left and right they ravaged the steep city,  sang how Odysseus marched right up to Deiphobus' house  like the god of war on attack with diehard Menelaus.  There, he sang, Odysseus fought the grimmest fight  he had ever braved but he won through at last,  thanks to Athena's superhuman power. </p>

<p>That was the song the famous harper sang  but great Odysseus melted into tears,  running down from his eyes to wet his cheeks ...  as a woman weeps, her arms flung round her darling husband,  a man who fell in battle, fighting for town and townsmen,  trying to beat the day of doom from home and children.  Seeing the man go down, dying, gasping for breath,  she clings for dear life, screams and shrills &mdash;  but the victors, just behind her,  digging spear-butts into her back and shoulders,  drag her off in bondage, yoked to hard labor, pain,  and the most heartbreaking torment wastes her cheeks.  So from Odysseus' eyes ran tears of heartbreak now.  But his weeping went unmarked by all the others;  only Alcinous, sitting close beside him,  noticed his guest's tears,  heard the groan in the man's labored breathing  and said at once to the master mariners around him,  &quot;Hear me, my lords and captains of Phaeacia!  Let Demodocus rest his ringing lyre now &mdash;  this song he sings can hardly please us all.  Ever since our meal began and the stirring bard  launched his song, our guest has never paused  in his tears and throbbing sorrow.  Clearly grief has overpowered his heart.  Break off this song! Let us a77enjoy ourselves,  the hosts and guest together. Much the warmer way.  All these things are performed for him, our honored guest,  the royal send-off here and gifts we give in love. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Treat your guest and suppliant like a brother: </p>

<p>anyone with a touch of sense knows that. </p>

<p>So don't be crafty now, my friend, don't hide </p>

<p>the truth I'm after. Fair is fair, speak out! </p>

<p>Come, tell us the name they call you there at home &mdash; </p>

<p>your mother, father, townsmen, neighbors round about. </p>

<p>Surely no man in the world is nameless, all told. </p>

<p>Born high, born low, as soon as he sees the light </p>

<p>his parents always name him, once he's born. </p>

<p>And tell me your land, your people, your city too, </p>

<p>so our ships can sail you home &mdash; their wits will speed them there. </p>

<p>For we have no steersmen here among Phaeacia's crews </p>

<p>or steering-oars that guide your common craft. </p>

<p>Our ships know in a flash their mates' intentions, </p>

<p>know all ports of call and all the rich green fields. </p>

<p>With wings of the wind they cross the sea's huge gulfs, </p>

<p>shrouded in mist and cloud &mdash; no fear in the world of foundering, </p>

<p>fatal shipwreck. </p>

<p>True, there's an old tale 1 heard  my father telling once. Nausithous used to say  that lord Poseidon was vexed with us because  we escorted all mankind and never came to grief.  He said that one day, as a well-built ship of ours  sailed home on the misty sea from such a convoy,  the god would crush it, yes,  and pile a huge mountain round about our port.  So the old king foretold ... And as for the god, well,  he can do his worst or leave it quite undone,  whatever warms his heart. </p>

<p>But come, my friend,  tell us your own story now, and tell it truly.  Where have your rovings forced you?  What lands of men have you seen, what sturdy towns,  what men themselves? Who were wild, savage, lawless?  Who were friendly to strangers, god-fearing men? Tell me,  why do you weep and grieve so sorely when you hear  the fate of the Argives, hear the fall of Troy? </p>

<p></p>

<p>That is the gods' work, spinning threads of death </p>

<p>through the lives of mortal men, </p>

<p>and all to make a song for those to come ... </p>

<p>Did one of your kinsmen die before the walls of Troy, </p>

<p>some brave man &mdash; a son by marriage? father by marriage? </p>

<p>Next to our own blood kin, our nearest, dearest ties. </p>

<p>Or a friend perhaps, someone close to your heart, </p>

<p>staunch and loyal? No less dear than a brother, </p>

<p>the brother-in-arms who shares our inmost thoughts.&quot; </p>

<p>Book IX </p>

<p></p>

<p>In the One-Eyed  Giant's Cave </p>

<p></p>

<p>Odysseus, the great teller of tales, launched out on his story: </p>

<p>&quot;Alcinous, majesty, shining among your island people, </p>

<p>what a fine thing it is to listen to such a bard </p>

<p>as we have here &mdash; ^the man sings like a god. </p>

<p>The crown of life, I'd say. There's nothing better </p>

<p>than when deep joy holds sway throughout the realm </p>

<p>and banqueters up and down the palace sit in ranks, </p>

<p>enthralled to hear the bard, and before them all, the tables </p>

<p>heaped with bread and meats, and drawing wine from a mixing-bowl </p>

<p>the steward makes his rounds and keeps the winecups flowing. </p>

<p>This, to my mind, is the best that life can offer. </p>

<p>But now </p>

<p>you're set on probing the bitter pains I've borne,  so I'm to weep and grieve, it seems, still more.  Well then, what shall 1 go through first,  what shall 1 save for last? </p>

<p></p>

<p>What pains &mdash; the gods have given me my share. </p>

<p>Now let me begin by telling you my name ... </p>

<p>so you may know it well and 1 in times to come, </p>

<p>if 1 can escape the fatal day, will be your host, </p>

<p>your sworn friend, though my home is far from here. </p>

<p>1 am Odysseus, son of Laertes, known to the world </p>

<p>for every kind of craft &mdash; my fame has reached the skies. </p>

<p>Sunny Ithaca is my home. Atop her stands our seamark, </p>

<p>Mount Neriton's leafy ridges shimmering in the wind. </p>

<p>Around her a ring of islands circle side-by-side, </p>

<p>Dulichion, Same, wooded Zacynthus too, but mine </p>

<p>lies low and away, the farthest out to sea, </p>

<p>rearing into the western dusk </p>

<p>while the others face the east and breaking day. </p>

<p>Mine is a rugged land but good for raising sons &mdash; </p>

<p>and 1 myself, 1 know no sweeter sight on earth </p>

<p>than a man's own native country. </p>

<p>True enough.  Calypso the lustrous goddess tried to hold me back,  deep in her arching caverns, craving me for a husband.  So did Circe, holding me just as warmly in her halls,  the bewitching queen of Aeaea keen to have me too.  But they never won the heart inside me, never.  So nothing is as sweet as a man's own country,  his own parents, even though he's settled down  in some luxurious house, off in a foreign land  and far from those who bore him. </p>

<p>No more. Come,  let me tell you about the voyage fraught with hardship  Zeus inflicted on me, homeward bound from Troy ... </p>

<p>The wind drove me out of Ilium on to Ismarus,  the Cicones' stronghold. There 1 sacked the city,  killed the men, but as for the wives and plunder,  that rich haul we dragged away from the place &mdash;  we shared it round so no one, not on my account,  would go deprived of his fair share of spoils. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Then I urged them to cut and run, set sail, </p>

<p>but would they listen? Not those mutinous fools; </p>

<p>there was too much wine to swill, too many sheep to slaughter </p>

<p>down along the beach, and shambling longhorn cattle. </p>

<p>And all the while the Cicones sought out other Cicones, </p>

<p>called for help from their neighbors living inland: </p>

<p>a larger force, and stronger soldiers too, </p>

<p>skilled hands at fighting men from chariots, </p>

<p>skilled, when a crisis broke, to fight on foot. </p>

<p>Out of the morning mist they came against us &mdash; </p>

<p>packed as the leaves and spears that flower forth in spring &mdash; </p>

<p>and Zeus presented us with disaster, me and my comrades </p>

<p>doomed to suffer blow on mortal blow. Lining up, </p>

<p>both armies battled it out against our swift ships, </p>

<p>both raked each other with hurtling bronze lances. </p>

<p>Long as morning rose and the blessed day grew stronger </p>

<p>we stood and fought them off, massed as they were, but then, </p>

<p>when the sun wheeled past the hour for unyoking oxen, </p>

<p>the Cicones broke our lines and beat us down at last. </p>

<p>Out of each ship, six men-at-arms were killed; </p>

<p>the rest of us rowed away from certain doom. </p>

<p>From there we sailed on, glad to escape our death  yet sick at heart for the dear companions we had lost.  But 1 would not let our rolling ships set sail until the crews  had raised the triple cry, saluting each poor comrade  cut down by the fierce Cicones on that plain.  Now Zeus who masses the stormclouds hit the fleet  with the North Wind &mdash; </p>

<p>a howling, demonic gale, shrouding over  in thunderheads the earth and sea at once &mdash; </p>

<p>and night swept down  from the sky and the ships went plunging headlong on,  our sails slashed to rags by the hurricane's blast!  We struck them &mdash; cringing at death we rowed our ships  to the nearest shoreline, pulled with all our power.  There, for two nights, two days, we lay by, no letup,  eating our hearts out, bent with pain and bone-tired. </p>

<p></p>

<p>when Dawn with her lovely locks brought on the third day,  then stepping the masts and hoisting white sails high,  we lounged at the oarlocks, letting wind and helmsmen  keep us true on course ... </p>

<p>And now, at long last,  1 might have reached my native land unscathed,  but just as 1 doubled Malea's cape, a tide-rip  and the North Wind drove me way off course,  careering past Cythera. </p>

<p>Nine whole days  1 was borne along by rough, deadly winds  on the fish-infested sea. Then on the tenth  our squadron reached the land of the Lotus-eaters,  people who eat the lotus, mellow fruit and flower.  We disembarked on the coast, drew water there  and crewmen snatched a meal by the swift ships.  Once we'd had our fill of food and drink 1 sent  a detail ahead, two picked men and a third, a runner,  to scout out who might live there &mdash; men like us perhaps,  who live on bread? So off they went and soon enough  they mingled among the natives. Lotus-eaters, Lotus-eaters  who had no notion of killing my companions, not at all,  they simply gave them the lotus to taste instead ...  Any crewmen who ate the lotus, the honey -sweet fruit,  lost all desire to send a message back, much less return,  their only wish to linger there with the Lotus-eaters,  grazing on lotus, all memory of the journey home  dissolved forever. But /brought them back, back  to the hollow ships, and streaming tears &mdash; 1 forced them,  hauled them under the rowing benches, lashed them fast  and shouted out commands to my other, steady comrades:  'Quick, no time to lose, embark in the racing ships!' &mdash;  so none could eat the lotus, forget the voyage home.  They swung aboard at once, they sat to the oars in ranks  and in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke. </p>

<p>From there we sailed on, our spirits now at a low ebb,  and reached the land of the high and mighty Cyclops, </p>

<p></p>

<p>lawless brutes, who trust so to the everlasting gods  they never plant with their own hands or plow the soil.  Unsown, unplowed, the earth teems with all they need,  wheat, barley and vines, swelled by the rains of Zeus  to yield a big full-bodied wine from clustered grapes.  They have no meeting place for council, no laws either,  no, up on the mountain peaks they live in arching caverns &mdash;  each a law to himself, ruling his wives and children,  not a care in the world for any neighbor. </p>

<p>Now, </p>

<p>a level island stretches flat across the harbor, </p>

<p>not close inshore to the Cyclops' coast, not too far out, </p>

<p>thick with woods where the wild goats breed by hundreds. </p>

<p>No trampling of men to start them from their lairs, </p>

<p>no hunters roughing it out on the woody ridges, </p>

<p>stalking quarry, ever raid their haven. </p>

<p>No flocks browse, no plowlands roll with wheat; </p>

<p>unplowed, unsown forever &mdash; empty of humankind &mdash; </p>

<p>the island just feeds droves of bleating goats. </p>

<p>For the Cyclops have no ships with crimson prows, </p>

<p>no shipwrights there to build them good trim craft </p>

<p>that could sail them out to foreign ports of call </p>

<p>as most men risk the seas to trade with other men. </p>

<p>Such artisans would have made this island too </p>

<p>a decent place to live in ... No mean spot, </p>

<p>it could bear you any crop you like in season. </p>

<p>The water-meadows along the low foaming shore </p>

<p>run soft and moist, and your vines would never flag. </p>

<p>The land's clear for plowing. Harvest on harvest, </p>

<p>a man could reap a healthy stand of grain &mdash; </p>

<p>the subsoil's dark and rich. </p>

<p>There's a snug deep-water harbor there, what's more,  no need for mooring-gear, no anchor-stones to heave,  no cables to make fast. Just beach your keels, ride out  the days till your shipmates' spirit stirs for open sea  and a fair wind blows. And last, at the harbor's head  there's a spring that rushes fresh from beneath a cave  and black poplars flourish round its mouth. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Well, </p>

<p>here we landed, and surely a god steered us in  through the pitch-black night.  Not that he ever showed himself, with thick fog  swirling around the ships, the moon wrapped in clouds  and not a glimmer stealing through that gloom.  Not one of us glimpsed the island &mdash; scanning hard &mdash;  or the long combers rolling us slowly toward the coast,  not till our ships had run their keels ashore.  Beaching our vessels smoothly, striking sail,  the crews swung out on the low shelving sand  and there we fell asleep, awaiting Dawn's first light. </p>

<p>When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more  we all turned out, intrigued to tour the island.  The local nymphs, the daughters of Zeus himself,  flushed mountain-goats so the crews could make their meal.  Quickly we fetched our curved bows and hunting spears  from the ships and, splitting up into three bands,  we started shooting, and soon enough some god  had sent us bags of game to warm our hearts.  A dozen vessels sailed in my command  and to each crew nine goats were shared out  and mine alone took ten. Then all day long  till the sun went down we sat and feasted well  on sides of meat and rounds of heady wine.  The good red stock in our vessels' holds  had not run out, there was still plenty left;  the men had carried off a generous store in jars  when we stormed and sacked the Cicones' holy city.  Now we stared across at the Cyclops' shore, so near  we could even see their smoke, hear their voices,  their bleating sheep and goats ...  And then when the sun had set and night came on  we lay down and slept at the water's shelving edge.  When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more  1 called a muster briskly, commanding all the hands.  The rest of you stay here, my friends-in arms. </p>

<p></p>

<p>I'll go across with my own ship and crew  and probe the natives living over there.  What are they &mdash; violent, savage, lawless?  or friendly to strangers, god-fearing men?' </p>

<p>With that 1 boarded ship and told the crew  to embark at once and cast off cables quickly.  They swung aboard, they sat to the oars in ranks  and in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke.  But as soon as we reached the coast 1 mentioned &mdash; no long trip &mdash;  we spied a cavern just at the shore, gaping above the surf,  towering, overgrown with laurel. And here big flocks,  sheep and goats, were stalled to spend the nights,  and around its mouth a yard was walled up  with quarried boulders sunk deep in the earth  and enormous pines and oak-trees looming darkly ...  Here was a giant's lair, in fact, who always pastured  his sheepflocks far afield and never mixed with others.  A grim loner, dead set in his own lawless ways.  Here was a piece of work, by god, a monster  built like no mortal who ever supped on bread,  no, like a shaggy peak, I'd say &mdash; a man-mountain  rearing head and shoulders over the world. </p>

<p>Now then, </p>

<p>1 told most of my good trusty crew to wait, </p>

<p>to sit tight by the ship and guard her well </p>

<p>while 1 picked out my dozen finest fighters </p>

<p>and off 1 went. But 1 took a skin of wine along, </p>

<p>the ruddy, irresistible wine that Maron gave me once, </p>

<p>Euanthes' son, a priest of Apollo, lord of Ismarus, </p>

<p>because we'd rescued him, his wife and children, </p>

<p>reverent as we were; </p>

<p>he lived, you see, in Apollo's holy grove. </p>

<p>And so in return he gave me splendid gifts, </p>

<p>he handed me seven bars of well-wrought gold, </p>

<p>a mixing-bowl of solid silver, then this wine ... </p>

<p>He drew it off in generous wine-jars, twelve in all, </p>

<p>all unmixed &mdash; and such a bouquet, a drink fit for the gods! </p>

<p></p>

<p>No maid or man of his household knew that secret store,  only himself, his loving wife and a single servant.  Whenever they 'd drink the deep-red mellow vintage,  twenty cups of water he'd stir in one of wine  and what an aroma wafted from the bowl &mdash;  what magic, what a godsend &mdash;  no joy in holding back when tJlat^Nas poured!  Filling a great goatskin now, 1 took this wine,  provisions too in a leather sack. A sudden foreboding  told my righting spirit I'd soon come up against  some giant clad in power like armor-plate &mdash;  a savage deaf to justice, blind to law. </p>

<p>Our party quickly made its way to his cave  but we failed to find our host himself inside;  he was off in his pasture, ranging his sleek flocks.  So we explored his den, gazing wide-eyed at it all,  the large flat racks loaded with drying cheeses,  the folds crowded with young lambs and kids,  split into three groups &mdash; here the spring-born,  here mid-yearlings, here the fresh sucklings  off to the side &mdash; each sort was penned apart.  And all his vessels, pails and hammered buckets  he used for milking, were brimming full with whey.  From the start my comrades pressed me, pleading hard,  'Let's make away with the cheeses, then come back &mdash;  hurry, drive the lambs and kids from the pens  to our swift ship, put out to sea at once!'  But 1 would not give way &mdash;  and how much better it would have been &mdash;  not till 1 saw him, saw what gifts he'd give.  But he proved no lovely sight to my companions. </p>

<p>There we built a fire, set our hands on the cheeses,  offered some to the gods and ate the bulk ourselves  and settled down inside, awaiting his return ...  And back he came from pasture, late in the day,  herding his flocks home, and lugging a huge load </p>

<p></p>

<p>of good dry logs to fuel his fire at supper.  He flung them down in the cave &mdash; a jolting crash &mdash;  we scuttled in panic into the deepest dark recess.  And next he drove his sleek flocks into the open vault,  all he'd milk at least, but he left the males outside,  rams and billy goats out in the high- walled yard.  Then to close his door he hoisted overhead  a tremendous, massive slab &mdash;  no twenty -two wagons, rugged and four-wheeled,  could budge that boulder off the ground, 1 tell you,  such an immense stone the monster wedged to block his cave!  Then down he squatted to milk his sheep and bleating goats,  each in order, and put a suckUng underneath each dam.  And half of the fresh white milk he curdled quickly,  set it aside in wicker racks to press for cheese,  the other half let stand in pails and buckets,  ready at hand to wash his supper down.  As soon as he'd briskly finished all his chores  he lit his fire and spied us in the blaze and  'Strangers! 'he thundered out, 'now who are you?  Where did you sail from, over the running sea-lanes?  Out on a trading spree or roving the waves like pirates,  sea-wolves raiding at will, who risk their lives  to plunder other men?' </p>

<p>The hearts inside us shook,  terrified by his rumbling voice and monstrous hulk.  Nevertheless 1 found the nerve to answer, firmly,  'Men of Achaea we are and bound now from Troy!  Driven far off course by the warring winds,  over the vast gulf of the sea &mdash; battling home  on a strange tack, a route that's off the map,  and so we've come to you ...  so it must please King Zeus's plotting heart.  We're glad to say we're men of Atrides Agamemnon,  whose fame is the proudest thing on earth these days,  so great a city he sacked, such multitudes he killed!  But since we've chanced on you, we're at your knees  in hopes of a warm welcome, even a guest-gift. </p>

<p></p>

<p>the sort that hosts give strangers. That's the custom.  Respect the gods, my friend. We're suppliants &mdash; at your mercy!  Zeus of the Strangers guards all guests and suppliants:  strangers are sacred &mdash; Zeus will avenge their rights!' </p>

<p>'Stranger/ he grumbled back from his brutal heart,  'you must be a fool, stranger, or come from nowhere,  telling me to fear the gods or avoid their wrath!  We Cyclops never blink at Zeus and Zeus's shield  of storm and thunder, or any other blessed god &mdash;  we've got more force by far.  I'd never spare you in fear of Zeus's hatred,  you or your comrades here, unless 1 had the urge.  But tell me, where did you moor your sturdy ship  when you arrived? Up the coast or close in?  I'd just like to know.' </p>

<p>So he laid his trap  but he never caught me, no, wise to the world  1 shot back in my crafty way, 'My ship?  Poseidon god of the earthquake smashed my ship,  he drove it against the rocks at your island's far cape,  dashed it against a cliff as the winds rode us in.  1 and the men you see escaped a sudden death.' </p>

<p>Not a word in reply to that, the ruthless brute.  Lurching up, he lunged out with his hands toward my men  and snatching two at once, rapping them on the ground  he knocked them dead like pups &mdash;  their brains gushed out all over, soaked the floor &mdash;  and ripping them limb from limb to fbc his meal  he bolted them down like a mountain-lion, left no scrap,  devoured entrails, flesh and bones, marrow and all!  We flung our arms to Zeus, we wept and cried aloud,  looking on at his grisly work &mdash; paralyzed, appalled.  But once the Cyclops had stuffed his enormous gut  with human flesh, washing it down with raw milk,  he slept in his cave, stretched out along his flocks.  And 1 with my fighting heart, 1 thought at first </p>

<p></p>

<p>to steal up to him, draw the sharp sword at my hip </p>

<p>and stab his chest where the midriff packs the liver &mdash; </p>

<p>1 groped for the fatal spot but a fresh thought held me back. </p>

<p>There at a stroke we'd finish off ourselves as well &mdash; </p>

<p>how could tvewith our bare hands heave back </p>

<p>that slab he set to block his cavern's gaping maw? </p>

<p>So we lay there groaning, waiting Dawn's first light. </p>

<p>When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more  the monster relit his fire and milked his handsome ewes,  each in order, putting a suckling underneath each dam,  and as soon as he'd briskly finished all his chores  he snatched up two more men and fixed his meal.  Well-fed, he drove his fat sheep from the cave,  lightly lifting the huge doorslab up and away,  then slipped it back in place  as a hunter flips the lid of his quiver shut.  Piercing whistles &mdash; turning his flocks to the hills  he left me there, the heart inside me brooding on revenge:  how could 1 pay him back? would Athena give me glory?  Here was the plan that struck my mind as best ...  the Cyclops' great club: there it lay by the pens,  olivewood, full of sap. He'd lopped it off to brandish  once it dried. Looking it over, we judged it big enough  to be the mast of a pitch-black ship with her twenty oars,  a freighter broad in the beam that plows through miles of sea &mdash;  so long, so thick it bulked before our eyes. Well,  flanking it now, 1 chopped off a fathom's length,  pushed it to comrades, told them to plane it down,  and they made the club smooth as 1 bent and shaved  the tip to a stabbing point. 1 turned it over  the blazing fire to char it good and hard,  then hid it well, buried deep under the dung  that littered the cavern's floor in thick wet clumps.  And now 1 ordered my shipmates all to cast lots &mdash;  who'd brave it out with me  to hoist our stake and grind it into his eye  when sleep had overcome him? Luck of the draw: </p>

<p></p>

<p>I got the very ones I would have picked myself,  four good men, and 1 in the lead made five ... </p>

<p>Nightfall brought him back, herding his woolly sheep  and he quickly drove the sleek flock into the vaulted cavern,  rams and all &mdash; none left outside in the walled yard &mdash;  his own idea, perhaps, or a god led him on.  Then he hoisted the huge slab to block the door  and squatted to milk his sheep and bleating goats,  each in order, putting a suckling underneath each dam,  and as soon as he'd briskly finished all his chores  he snatched up two more men and fixed his meal.  But this time 1 lifted a carved wooden bowl,  brimful of my ruddy wine,  and went right up to the Cyclops, enticing,  'Here, Cyclops, try this wine &mdash; to top off  the banquet of human flesh you've bolted down!  Judge for yourself what stock our ship had stored.  1 brought it here to make you a fine libation,  hoping you would pity me, Cyclops, send me home,  but your rages are insufferable. You barbarian &mdash;  how can any man on earth come visit you after this?  What you've done outrages all that's right!' </p>

<p>At that he seized the bowl and tossed it off  and the heady wine pleased him immensely. 'More' &mdash;  he demanded a second bowl &mdash; 'a hearty helping!  And tell me your name now, quickly,  so 1 can hand my guest a gift to warm Azs heart.  Our soil yields the Cyclops powerful, full-bodied wine  and the rains from Zeus build its strength. But this,  this is nectar, ambrosia &mdash; this flows from heaven!' </p>

<p>So he declared. 1 poured him another fiery bowl &mdash;  three bowls 1 brimmed and three he drank to the last drop,  the fool, and then, when the wine was swirling round his brain,  1 approached my host with a cordial, winning word:  'So, you ask me the name I'm known by, Cyclops? </p>

<p></p>

<p>I will tell you. But you must give me a guest-gift </p>

<p>as you've promised. Nobody &mdash; that's my name. Nobody &mdash; </p>

<p>so my mother and father call me, all my friends.' </p>

<p>But he boomed back at me from his ruthless heart,  'Nobody?\'\\ eat Nobody last of all his friends &mdash;  I'll eat the others first! That's my gift to you!' </p>

<p>With that </p>

<p>he toppled over, sprawled full-length, flat on his back  and lay there, his massive neck slumping to one side,  and sleep that conquers all overwhelmed him now  as wine came spurting, flooding up from his gullet  with chunks of human flesh &mdash; he vomited, blind drunk.  Now, at last, 1 thrust our stake in a bed of embers  to get it red-hot and rallied all my comrades:  Courage &mdash; no panic, no one hang back now!'  And green as it was, just as the olive stake  was about to catch fire &mdash; the glow terrific, yes &mdash;  1 dragged it from the flames, my men clustering round  as some god breathed enormous courage through us all.  Hoisting high that olive stake with its stabbing point,  straight into the monster's eye they rammed it hard &mdash;  1 drove my weight on it from above and bored it home  as a shipwright bores his beam with a shipwright's drill  that men below, whipping the strap back and forth, whirl  and the drill keeps twisting faster, never stopping &mdash;  So we seized our stake with its fiery tip  and bored it round and round in the giant's eye  till blood came boiling up around that smoking shaft  and the hot blast singed his brow and eyelids round the core  and the broiling eyeball burst &mdash; </p>

<p>its crackling roots blazed </p>

<p>and hissed &mdash; </p>

<p>as a blacksmith plunges a glowing ax or adze  in an ice-cold bath and the metal screeches steam  and its temper hardens &mdash; that's the iron's strength &mdash;  so the eye of the Cyclops sizzled round that stake!  He loosed a hideous roar, the rock walls echoed round </p>

<p></p>

<p>and we scuttled back in terror. The monster wrenched the spike  from his eye and out it came with a red geyser of blood &mdash;  he flung it aside with frantic hands, and mad with pain  he bellowed out for help from his neighbor Cyclops  living round about in caves on windswept crags.  Hearing his cries, they lumbered up from every side  and hulking round his cavern, asked what ailed him:  'What, Polyphemus, what in the world's the trouble?  Roaring out in the godsent night to rob us of our sleep.  Surely no one's rustling your flocks against your will &mdash;  surely no one's trying to kill you now by fraud or force!' </p>

<p>'Nobody, friends' &mdash; Polyphemus bellowed back from his cave &mdash;  Nobody's killing me now by fraud and not by force.&quot; </p>

<p>7/you're alone,' his friends boomed back at once,  'and nobody's trying to overpower you now &mdash; look,  it must be a plague sent here by mighty Zeus  and there's no escape from that  You'd better pray to your father, Lord Poseidon.' </p>

<p>They lumbered off, but laughter filled my heart  to think how nobody's name &mdash; my great cunning stroke &mdash;  had duped them one and all. But the Cyclops there,  still groaning, racked with agony, groped around  for the huge slab, and heaving it from the doorway,  down he sat in the cave's mouth, his arms spread wide,  hoping to catch a comrade stealing out with sheep &mdash;  such a blithering fool he took me for!  But 1 was already plotting ...  what was the best way out? how could 1 find  escape from death for my crew, myself as well?  My wits kept weaving, weaving cunning schemes &mdash;  life at stake, monstrous death staring us in the face &mdash;  till this plan struck my mind as best. That flock,  those well-fed rams with their splendid thick fleece,  sturdy, handsome beasts sporting their dark weight of wool: </p>

<p></p>

<p>I lashed them abreast, quietly, twisting the willow-twigs  the Cyclops slept on &mdash; giant, lawless brute &mdash; I took them  three by three; each ram in the middle bore a man  while the two rams either side would shield him well.  So three beasts to bear each man, but as for myself?  There was one bellwether ram, the prize of all the flock,  and clutching him by his back, tucked up under  his shaggy belly, there 1 hung, face upward,  both hands locked in his marvelous deep fleece,  clinging for dear life, my spirit steeled, enduring ...  So we held on, desperate, waiting Dawn's first light. </p>

<p>As soon </p>

<p>as young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more  the rams went rumbling out of the cave toward pasture,  the ewes kept bleating round the pens, unmilked,  their udders about to burst. Their master now,  heaving in torment, felt the back of each animal  halting before him here, but the idiot never sensed  my men were trussed up under their thick fleecy ribs.  And last of them all came my great ram now, striding out,  weighed down with his dense wool and my deep plots.  Stroking him gently, powerful Polyphemus murmured,  'Dear old ram, why last of the flock to quit the cave?  In the good old days you'd never lag behind the rest &mdash;  you with your long marching strides, first by far  of the flock to graze the fresh young grasses,  first by far to reach the rippling streams,  first to turn back home, keen for your fold  when night comes on &mdash; but now you're last of all.  And why? Sick at heart for your master's eye  that coward gouged out with his wicked crew? &mdash;  only after he'd stunned my wits with wine &mdash;  that, that Nobody ... </p>

<p>who's not escaped his death, 1 swear, not yet. </p>

<p>Oh if only you thought like me, had words like me </p>

<p>to tell me where that scoundrel is cringing from my rage! </p>

<p>I'd smash him against the ground, I'd spill his brains &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>flooding across my cave &mdash; and that would ease my heart  of the pains that good-for-nothing Nobody made me suffer!' </p>

<p>And with that threat he let my ram go free outside.  But soon as we'd got one foot past cave and courtyard,  first 1 loosed myself from the ram, then loosed my men,  then quickly, glancing back again and again we drove  our flock, good plump beasts with their long sharks,  straight to the ship, and a welcome sight we were  to loyal comrades &mdash; we who'd escaped our deaths &mdash;  but for all the rest they broke down and wailed.  1 cut it short, 1 stopped each shipmate's cries,  my head tossing, brows frowning, silent signals  to hurry, tumble our fleecy herd on board,  launch out on the open sea!  They swung aboard, they sat to the oars in rank;  and in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke.  But once offshore as far as a man's shout can carry,  1 called back to the Cyclops, stinging taunts:  'So, Cyclops, no weak coward it was whose crew  you bent to devour there in your vaulted cave &mdash; .  you with your brute force! Your filthy crimes  came down on your own head, you shameless cannibal,  daring to eat your guests in your own house &mdash;  so Zeus and the other gods have paid you back!' </p>

<p>That made the rage of the monster boil over.  Ripping off the peak of a towering crag, he heaved it  so hard the boulder landed just in front of our dark prow  and a huge swell reared up as the rock went plunging under &mdash;  a tidal wave from the open sea. The sudden backwash  drove us landward again, forcing us close inshore  but grabbing a long pole, 1 thrust us off and away,  tossing my head for dear life, signaling crews  to put their backs in the oars, escape grim death.  They threw themselves in the labor, rowed on fast  but once we'd plowed the breakers twice as far,  again 1 began to taunt the Cyclops &mdash; men around me </p>

<p></p>

<p>trying to check me, calm me, left and right: </p>

<p>'So headstrong &mdash; why? Why rile the beast again?' </p>

<p>'That rock he flung in the sea just now, hurling our ship  to shore once more &mdash; we thought we'd die on the spot!' </p>

<p>'If he'd caught a sound from oneoi us, just a whisper,  he would have crushed our heads and ship timbers  with one heave of another flashing, jagged rock!' </p>

<p>'Good god, the brute can throw!' </p>

<p>So they begged </p>

<p>but they could not bring my fighting spirit round.  1 called back with another burst of anger, 'Cyclops &mdash;  if any man on the face of the earth should ask you  who blinded you, shamed you so &mdash; say Odysseus,  raider of cities, gouged out your eye,  Laertes' son who makes his home in Ithaca!' </p>

<p>So 1 vaunted and he groaned back in answer,  'Oh no, no &mdash; ^that prophecy years ago ...  it all comes home to me with a vengeance now!  We once had a prophet here, a great tall man,  Telemus, Eurymus' son, a master at reading signs,  who grew old in his trade among his fellow-Cyclops.  All this, he warned me, would come to pass someday &mdash;  that I'd be blinded here at the hands of one Odysseus.  But 1 always looked for a handsome giant man to cross my path,  some fighter clad in power like armor-plate, but now,  look what a dwarf, a spineless good-for-nothing,  stuns me with wine, then gouges out my eye!  Come here, Odysseus, let me give you a guest-gift  and urge Poseidon the earthquake god to speed you home.  1 am his son and he claims to be my father, true,  and he himself will heal me if he pleases &mdash;  no other blessed god, no man can do the work!' </p>

<p>'7/ea7you!'&mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>here was my parting shot &mdash; Would to god I could strip you  of life and breath and ship you down to the House of Death  as surely as no one will ever heal your eye,  not even your earthquake god himself!' </p>

<p>But at that he bellowed out to lord Poseidon,  thrusting his arms to the starry skies, and prayed, 'Hear me &mdash;  Poseidon, god of the sea-blue mane who rocks the earth!  If 1 really am your son and you claim to be my father &mdash;  come, grant that Odysseus, raider of cities,  Laertes' son who makes his home in Ithaca,  never reaches home. Or if he's fated to see  his people once again and reach his well-built house  and his own native country, let him come home late  and come a broken man &mdash; all shipmates lost,  alone in a stranger's ship &mdash;  and let him find a world of pain at home!' </p>

<p>So he prayed </p>

<p>and the god of the sea-blue mane Poseidon heard his prayer. </p>

<p>The monster suddenly hoisted a boulder &mdash; far larger &mdash; </p>

<p>wheeled and heaved it, putting his weight behind it, </p>

<p>massive strength, and the boulder crashed close, </p>

<p>landing just in the wake of our dark stern, </p>

<p>just failing to graze the rudder's bladed edge. </p>

<p>A huge swell reared up as the rock went plunging under, </p>

<p>yes, and the tidal breaker drove us out to our island's </p>

<p>far shore where all my well-decked ships lay moored, </p>

<p>clustered, waiting, and huddled round them, crewmen </p>

<p>sat in anguish, waiting, chafing for our return. </p>

<p>We beached our vessel hard ashore on the sand, </p>

<p>we swung out in the frothing surf ourselves, </p>

<p>and herding Cyclops' sheep from our deep holds </p>

<p>we shared them round so no one, not on my account, </p>

<p>would go deprived of his fair share of spoils. </p>

<p>But the splendid ram &mdash; as we meted out the flocks </p>

<p>my f riends-in-arms made him my prize of honor, </p>

<p>mine alone, and 1 slaughtered him on the beach </p>

<p>and burnt his thighs to Cronus' mighty son. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Zeus of the thundercloud who rules the world. </p>

<p>But my sacrifices failed to move the god: </p>

<p>Zeus was still obsessed with plans to destroy </p>

<p>my entire oarswept fleet and loyal crew of comrades. </p>

<p>Now all day long till the sun went down we sat </p>

<p>and feasted on sides of meat and heady wine. </p>

<p>Then when the sun had set and night came on </p>

<p>we lay down and slept at the water's shelving edge. </p>

<p>When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more </p>

<p>1 roused the men straightway, ordering all crews </p>

<p>to man the ships and cast off cables quickly. </p>

<p>They swung aboard at once, they sat to the oars in ranks </p>

<p>and in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke. </p>

<p>And from there we sailed on, glad to escape our death </p>

<p>yet sick at heart for the comrades we had lost.&quot; </p>

<p>BookX </p>

<p></p>

<p>The Bewitching  Queen of Aeaea </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;We reached the Aeolian island next, the home of Aeolus, </p>

<p>Hippotas' son, beloved by the gods who never die &mdash; </p>

<p>a great floating island it was, and round it all </p>

<p>huge ramparts rise of indestructible bronze </p>

<p>and sheer rock cliffs shoot up from sea to sky. </p>

<p>The king had sired twelve children within his halls, </p>

<p>six daughters and six sons in the lusty prime of youth, </p>

<p>so he gave his daughters as wives to his six sons. </p>

<p>Seated beside their dear father and doting mother, </p>

<p>with delicacies aplenty spread before them, </p>

<p>they feast on forever ... All day long </p>

<p>the halls breathe the savor of roasted meats </p>

<p>and echo round to the low moan of blowing pipes, </p>

<p>and all night long, each one by his faithful mate, </p>

<p>they sleep under soft-piled rugs on corded bedsteads. </p>

<p></p>

<p>To this city of theirs we came, their splendid palace, </p>

<p>and Aeolus hosted me one entire month, he pressed me for news </p>

<p>of Troy and the Argive ships and how we sailed for home, </p>

<p>and 1 told him the whole long story, first to last. </p>

<p>And then, when 1 begged him to send me on my way, </p>

<p>he denied me nothing, he went about my passage. </p>

<p>He gave me a sack, the skin of a full-grown ox, </p>

<p>binding inside the winds that howl from every quarter, </p>

<p>for Zeus had made that king the master of all the winds, </p>

<p>with power to calm them down or rouse them as he pleased. </p>

<p>Aeolus stowed the sack inside my holds, lashed so fast </p>

<p>with a burnished silver cord </p>

<p>not even a slight puff could slip past that knot. </p>

<p>Yet he set the West Wind free to blow us on our way </p>

<p>and waft our squadron home. But his plan was bound to fail, </p>

<p>yes, our own reckless folly swept us on to ruin ... </p>

<p>Nine whole days we sailed, nine nights, nonstop.  On the tenth our own land hove into sight at last &mdash;  we were so close we could see men tending fires.  But now an enticing sleep came on me, bone-weary  from working the vessel's sheet myself, no letup,  never trusting the ropes to any other mate,  the faster to journey back to native land.  But the crews began to mutter among themselves,  sure 1 was hauling troves of gold and silver home,  the gifts of open-hearted Aeolus, Hippotas' son.  'The old story!' One man glanced at another, grumbling.  'Look at our captain's luck &mdash; so loved by the world,  so prized at every landfall, every port of call.' </p>

<p>'Heaps of lovely plunder he hauls home from Troy,  while we who went through slogging just as hard,  we go home empty-handed.' </p>

<p>'Now this Aeolus loads him  down with treasure. Favoritism, friend to friend!' </p>

<p></p>

<p>'Hurry, let's see what loot is in that sack,  how much gold and silver. Break it open &mdash; now!' </p>

<p>A fatal plan, but it won my shipmates over.  They loosed the sack and all the winds burst out  and a sudden squall struck and swept us back to sea,  wailing, in tears, far from our own native land.  And 1 woke up with a start, my spirit churning &mdash;  should 1 leap over the side and drown at once  or grin and bear it, stay among the living?  1 bore it all, held firm,  hiding my face, clinging tight to the decks  while heavy squalls blasted our squadron back  again to Aeolus' island, shipmates groaning hard. </p>

<p>We disembarked on the coast, drew water there  and crewmen snatched a meal by the swift ships.  Once we'd had our fill of food and drink  1 took a shipmate along with me, a herald too,  and approached King Aeolus' famous halls and here  we found him feasting beside his wife and many children.  Reaching the doorposts at the threshold, down we sat  but our hosts, amazed to see us, only shouted questions:  'Back again, Odysseus &mdash; ^why? Some blustering god attacked you?  Surely we launched you well, we sped you on your way  to your own land and house, or any place you pleased.' </p>

<p>So they taunted, and 1 replied in deep despair,  'A mutinous crew undid me &mdash; that and a cruel sleep.  Set it to rights, my friends. You have the power!' </p>

<p>So 1 pleaded &mdash; gentle, humble appeals &mdash;  but our hosts turned silent, hushed ...  and the father broke forth with an ultimatum:  'Away from my island &mdash; fast &mdash; most cursed man alive!  It's a crime to host a man or speed him on his way  when the blessed deathless gods despise him so.  Crawling back like this&mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>it proves the immortals hate you! Out &mdash; get out!' </p>

<p>Groan as I did, his curses drove me from his halls  and from there we pulled away with heavy hearts,  with the crews' spirit broken under the oars' labor,  thanks to our own folly ... no favoring wind in sight. </p>

<p>Six whole days we rowed, six nights, nonstop.  On the seventh day we raised the Laestrygonian land,  Telepylus heights where the craggy fort of Lamus rises.  Where shepherd calls to shepherd as one drives in his flocks  and the other drives his out and he calls back in answer,  where a man who never sleeps could rake in double wages,  one for herding cattle, one for pasturing fleecy sheep,  the nightfall and the sunrise march so close together.  We entered a fine harbor there, all walled around  by a great unbroken sweep of sky -scraping cliff  and two steep headlands, fronting each other, close  around the mouth so the passage in is cramped.  Here the rest of my rolling squadron steered,  right into the gaping cove and moored tightly,  prow by prow. Never a swell there, big or small;  a milk-white calm spreads all around the place.  But 1 alone anchored my black ship outside,  well clear of the harbor's jaws  1 tied her fast to a cliff side with a cable.  1 scaled its rock face to a lookout on its crest  but glimpsed no trace of the work of man or beast from there;  all 1 spied was a plume of smoke, drifting off the land.  So 1 sent some crew ahead to learn who lived there &mdash;  men like us perhaps, who live f?/? bread?  Two good mates 1 chose and a third to run the news.  They disembarked and set out on a beaten trail  the wagons used for hauling timber down to town  from the mountain heights above ...  and before the walls they met a girl, drawing water,  Antiphates' strapping daughter &mdash; king of the Laestrygonians. </p>

<p></p>

<p>She'd come down to a clear running spring, Artacia, </p>

<p>where the local people came to fill their pails. </p>

<p>My shipmates clustered round her, asking questions: </p>

<p>who was king of the realm? who ruled the natives here? </p>

<p>She waved at once to her father's high-roofed halls. </p>

<p>They entered the sumptuous palace, found his wife inside &mdash; </p>

<p>a woman huge as a mountain crag who filled them all with horror. </p>

<p>Straightaway she summoned royal Antiphates from assembly, </p>

<p>her husband, who prepared my crew a barbarous welcome. </p>

<p>Snatching one of my men, he tore him up for dinner &mdash; </p>

<p>the other two sprang free and reached the ships. </p>

<p>But the king let loose a howling through the town </p>

<p>that brought tremendous Laestrygonians swarming up </p>

<p>from every side &mdash; hundreds, not like men, like Giants' </p>

<p>Down from the cliffs they flung great rocks a man could hardly hoist </p>

<p>and a ghastly shattering din rose up from all the ships &mdash; </p>

<p>men in their death-cries, hulls smashed to splinters &mdash; </p>

<p>They speared the crews like fish </p>

<p>and whisked them home to make their grisly meal. </p>

<p>But while they killed them off in the harbor depths </p>

<p>1 pulled the sword from beside my hip and hacked away </p>

<p>at the ropes that moored my blue-prowed ship of war </p>

<p>and shouted rapid orders at my shipmates: </p>

<p>'Put your backs in the oars &mdash; now row or die!' </p>

<p>In terror of death they ripped the swells &mdash; all as one &mdash; </p>

<p>and what a joy as we darted out toward open sea, </p>

<p>clear of those beetling cliffs ... my ship alone. </p>

<p>But the rest went down en masse. Our squadron sank. </p>

<p>From there we sailed on, glad to escape our death  yet sick at heart for the dear companions we had lost.  We reached the Aeaean island next, the home of Circe  the nymph with lovely braids, an awesome power too  who can speak with human voice,  the true sister of murderous-minded Aeetes.  Both were bred by the Sun who lights our lives;  their mother was Perse, a child the Ocean bore.  We brought our ship to port without a sound </p>

<p></p>

<p>as a god eased her into a harbor safe and snug, </p>

<p>and for two days and two nights we lay by there, </p>

<p>eating our hearts out, bent with pain and bone-tired. </p>

<p>When Dawn with her lovely locks brought on the third day, </p>

<p>at last 1 took my spear and my sharp sword again, </p>

<p>rushed up from the ship to find a lookout point, </p>

<p>hoping to glimpse some sign of human labor, </p>

<p>catch some human voices ... </p>

<p>1 scaled a commanding crag and, scanning hard, </p>

<p>1 could just make out some smoke from Circe's halls, </p>

<p>drifting up from the broad terrain through brush and woods. </p>

<p>Mulling it over, 1 thought I'd scout the ground &mdash; </p>

<p>that fire aglow in the smoke, 1 saw it, true, </p>

<p>but soon enough this seemed the better plan: </p>

<p>I'd go back to shore and the swift ship first, </p>

<p>feed the men, then send them out for scouting. </p>

<p>1 was well on my way down, nearing our ship </p>

<p>when a god took pity on me, wandering all alone; </p>

<p>he sent me a big stag with high branching antlers, </p>

<p>right across my path &mdash; the sun's heat forced him down </p>

<p>from his forest range to drink at a river's banks &mdash; </p>

<p>just bounding out of the timber when 1 hit him </p>

<p>square in the backbone, halfway down the spine </p>

<p>and my bronze spear went punching clean through &mdash; </p>

<p>he dropped in the dust, groaning, gasping out his breath. </p>

<p>Treading on him, 1 wrenched my bronze spear from the wound, </p>

<p>left it there on the ground, and snapping off some twigs </p>

<p>and creepers, twisted a rope about a fathom long, </p>

<p>1 braided it tight, hand over hand, then lashed </p>

<p>the four hocks of that magnificent beast. </p>

<p>Loaded round my neck 1 lugged him toward the ship, </p>

<p>trudging, propped on my spear &mdash; no way to sling him </p>

<p>over a shoulder, steadying him with one free arm &mdash; </p>

<p>the kill was so immense! </p>

<p>1 flung him down by the hull and roused the men,  going up to them all with a word to lift their spirits:  'Listen to me, my comrades, brothers in hardship &mdash;  we won't go down to the House of Death, not yet. </p>

<p></p>

<p>not till our day arrives. Up with you, look,  there's still some meat and drink in our good ship.  Put our minds on food &mdash; why die of hunger here?' </p>

<p>My hardy urging brought them round at once.  Heads came up from cloaks and there by the barren sea  they gazed at the stag, their eyes wide &mdash; my noble trophy.  But once they'd looked their fill and warmed their hearts,  they washed their hands and prepared a splendid meal.  Now all day long till the sun went down we sat  and feasted on sides of meat and seasoned wine.  Then when the sun had set and night came on  we lay down and slept at the water 's shelving edge.  When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more  1 called a muster quickly, informing all the crew,  'Listen to me, my comrades, brothers in hardship,  we can't tell east from west, the dawn from the dusk,  nor where the sun that lights our lives goes under earth  nor where it rises. We must think of a plan at once,  some cunning stroke. 1 doubt there's one still left.  1 scaled a commanding crag and from that height  surveyed an entire island  ringed like a crown by endless wastes of sea.  But the land itself lies low, and 1 did see smoke  drifting up from its heart through thick brush and woods. ' </p>

<p>My message broke their spirit as they recalled  the gruesome work of the Laestrygonian king Antiphates  and the hearty cannibal Cyclops thirsting for our blood.  They burst into cries, wailing, streaming live tears  that gained us nothing &mdash; what good can come of grief? </p>

<p>And so, numbering off my band of men-at-arms  into two platoons, 1 assigned them each a leader:  1 took one and lord Eurylochus the other.  We quickly shook lots in a bronze helmet &mdash;  the lot of brave Eurylochus leapt out first.  So he moved off with his two and twenty comrades. </p>

<p></p>

<p>weeping, leaving us behind in tears as well ... </p>

<p>Deep in the wooded glens they came on Circe's palace </p>

<p>built of dressed stone on a cleared rise of land. </p>

<p>Mountain wolves and lions were roaming round the grounds &mdash; </p>

<p>she'd bewitched them herself, she gave them magic drugs. </p>

<p>But they wouldn't attack my men; they just came pawing </p>

<p>up around them, fawning, swishing their long tails &mdash; </p>

<p>eager as hounds that fawn around their master, </p>

<p>coming home from a feast, </p>

<p>who always brings back scraps to calm them down.  So they came nuzzling round my men &mdash; lions, wolves  with big powerful claws &mdash; and the men cringed in fear  at sight of those strange, ferocious beasts ... But still  they paused at her doors, the nymph with lovely braids,  Circe &mdash; and deep inside they heard her singing, lifting  her spellbinding voice as she glided back and forth  at her great immortal loom, her enchanting web  a shimmering glory only goddesses can weave.  Polites, captain of armies, took command,  the closest, most devoted man 1 had: 'Friends,  there's someone inside, plying a great loom,  and how she sings &mdash; enthralling!  The whole house is echoing to her song.  Goddess or woman &mdash; let's call out to her now!' </p>

<p>So he urged and the men called out and hailed her.  She opened her gleaming doors at once and stepped forth,  inviting them all in, and in they went, all innocence.  Only Eurylochus stayed behind &mdash; he sensed a trap ...  She ushered them in to sit on high-backed chairs,  then she mixed them a potion &mdash; cheese, barley  and pale honey mulled in Pramnian wine &mdash;  but into the brew she stirred her wicked drugs  to wipe from their memories any thought of home.  Once they'd drained the bowls she filled, suddenly  she struck with her wand, drove them into her pigsties,  all of them bristling into swine &mdash; ^with grunts,  snouts &mdash; even their bodies, yes, and only </p>

<p></p>

<p>the men's minds stayed steadfast as before.  So off they went to their pens, sobbing, squealing  as Circe flung them acorns, cornel nuts and mast,  common fodder for hogs that root and roll in mud. </p>

<p>Back Eurylochus ran to our swift black ship  to tell the disaster our poor friends had faced.  But try as he might, he couldn't get a word out.  Numbing sorrow had stunned the man to silence &mdash;  tears welled in his eyes, his heart possessed by grief.  We assailed him with questions &mdash; all at our wits' end &mdash;  till at last he could recount the fate our friends had met:  'Off we went through the brush, captain, as you commanded.  Deep in the wooded glens we came on Circe's palace  built of dressed stone on a cleared rise of land.  Someone inside was plying a great loom,  and how she sang &mdash; in a high clear voice!  Goddess or woman &mdash; we called out and hailed her ...  She opened her gleaming doors at once and stepped forth,  inviting us all in, and in we went, all innocence.  But /stayed behind &mdash; 1 sensed a trap. Suddenly  all vanished &mdash; blotted out &mdash; not one face showed again,  though 1 sat there keeping watch a good long time.' </p>

<p>At that report 1 slung the hefty bronze blade  of my silver-studded sword around my shoulder,  slung my bow on too and told our comrade,  'Lead me back by the same way that you came. '  But he flung both arms around my knees and pleaded,  begging me with his tears and winging words:  'Don't force me back there, captain, king &mdash;  leave me here on the spot.  You will never return yourself, 1 swear,  you'll never bring back a single man alive.  Quick, cut and run with the rest of us here &mdash;  we can still escape the fatal day!' </p>

<p></p>

<p>But I shot back, Eurylochus, stay right here,  eating, drinking, safe by the black ship.  I must be off. Necessity drives me on.' </p>

<p>Leaving the ship and shore, I headed inland,  clambering up through hushed, entrancing glades until,  as 1 was nearing the halls of Circe skilled in spells,  approaching her palace &mdash; Hermes god of the golden wand  crossed my path, and he looked for all the world  like a young man sporting his first beard,  just in the prime and warm pride of youth,  and grasped me by the hand and asked me kindly,  'Where are you going now, my unlucky friend &mdash;  trekking over the hills alone in unfamiliar country?  And your men are all in there, in Circe's palace,  cooped like swine, hock by jowl in the sties.  Have you come to set them free?  Well, 1 warn you, you won't get home yourself,  you'll stay right there, trapped with all the rest.  But wait, 1 can save you, free you from that great danger.  Look, here is a potent drug. Take it to Circe's halls &mdash;  its power alone will shield you from the fatal day.  Let me tell you of all the witch's subtle craft ...  She'll mix you a potion, lace the brew with drugs  but she'll be powerless to bewitch you, even so &mdash;  this magic herb 1 give will fight her spells.  Now here's your plan of action, step by step.  The moment Circe strikes with her long thin wand,  you draw your sharp sword sheathed at your hip  and rush her fast as if to run her through!  She'll cower in fear and coax you to her bed &mdash;  but don't refuse the goddess' bed, not then, not if  she's to release your friends and treat you well yourself.  But have her swear the binding oath of the blessed gods  she'll never plot some new intrigue to harm you,  once you lie there naked &mdash;  never unman you, strip away your courage!' </p>

<p>With that </p>

<p>the giant-killer handed over the magic herb. </p>

<p></p>

<p>pulling it from the earth, </p>

<p>and Hermes showed me all its name and nature. </p>

<p>Its root is black and its flower white as milk </p>

<p>and the gods call it moly. Dangerous for a mortal man </p>

<p>to pluck from the soil but not for deathless gods. </p>

<p>All lies within their power. </p>

<p>Now Hermes went his way  to the steep heights of Olympus, over the island's woods  while 1, just approaching the halls of Circe,  my heart a heaving storm at every step,  paused at her doors, the nymph with lovely braids &mdash;  1 stood and shouted to her there. She heard my voice,  she opened the gleaming doors at once and stepped forth,  inviting me in, and in 1 went, all anguish now ...  She led me in to sit on a silver-studded chair,  ornately carved, with a stool to rest my feet.  In a golden bowl she mixed a potion for me to drink,  stirring her poison in, her heart aswirl with evil.  And then she passed it on, 1 drank it down  but it never worked its spell &mdash;  she struck with her wand and 'Now,' she cried,  'off to your sty, you swine, and wallow with your friends!'  But 1, 1 drew my sharp sword sheathed at my hip  and rushed her fast as if to run her through &mdash;  She screamed, slid under my blade, hugged my knees  with a flood of warm tears and a burst of winging words:  'Who are you? where are you from? your city? your parents?  I'm wonderstruck &mdash; you drank my drugs, you're not bewitched!  Never has any other man withstood my potion, never,  once it's past his lips and he has drunk it down.  You have a mind in you no magic can enchant!  You must be Odysseus, man of twists and turns &mdash;  Hermes the giant-killer, god of the golden wand,  he always said you'd come, </p>

<p>homeward bound from Troy in your swift black ship.  Come, sheathe your sword, let's go to bed together,  mount my bed and mix in the magic work of love &mdash;  we'll breed deep trust between us. ' </p>

<p></p>

<p>So she enticed  but I fought back, still wary. 'Circe, Circe,  how dare you tell me to treat you with any warmth?  You who turned my men to swine in your own house and now  you hold me here as well &mdash; teeming with treachery  you lure me to your room to mount your bed,  so once 1 lie there naked  you'll unman me, strip away my courage!  Mount your bed? Not for all the world. Not  until you consent to swear, goddess, a binding oath  you'll never plot some new intrigue to harm me!' </p>

<p>Straightaway  she began to swear the oath that 1 required &mdash; never,  she'd never do me harm &mdash; and when she'd finished,  then, at last, 1 mounted Circe's gorgeous bed ... </p>

<p>At the same time her handmaids bustled through the halls,  four in all who perform the goddess' household tasks:  nymphs, daughters born of the springs and groves  and the sacred rivers running down to open sea.  One draped the chairs with fine crimson covers  over the seats she'd spread with linen cloths below.  A second drew up silver tables before the chairs  and laid out golden trays to hold the bread.  A third mulled heady, heart- warming wine  in a silver bowl and set out golden cups.  A fourth brought water and lit a blazing fire  beneath a massive cauldron. The water heated soon,  and once it reached the boil in the glowing bronze  she eased me into a tub and bathed me from the cauldron,  mixing the hot and cold to suit my taste, showering  head and shoulders down until she'd washed away  the spirit-numbing exhaustion from my body.  The bathing finished, rubbing me sleek with oil,  throwing warm fleece and a shirt around my shoulders,  she led me in to sit on a silver-studded chair,  ornately carved, with a stool to rest my feet.  A maid brought water soon in a graceful golden pitcher </p>

<p></p>

<p>and over a silver basin tipped it out </p>

<p>so I might rinse my hands, </p>

<p>then pulled a gleaming table to my side. </p>

<p>A staid housekeeper brought on bread to serve me, </p>

<p>appetizers aplenty too, lavish with her bounty. </p>

<p>She pressed me to eat. 1 had no taste for food. </p>

<p>1 just sat there, mind wandering, far away ... </p>

<p>lost in grim forebodings. </p>

<p>As soon as Circe saw me,  huddled, not touching my food, immersed in sorrow,  she sidled near with a coaxing, winged word:  'Odysseus, why just sit there, struck dumb,  eating your heart out, not touching food or drink?  Suspect me of still more treachery? Nothing to fear.  Haven't 1 just sworn my solemn, binding oath?' </p>

<p>So she asked, but 1 protested, Circe &mdash;  how could any man in his right mind endure  the taste of food and drink before he'd freed  his comrades-in-arms and looked them in the eyes?  If you, you really want me to eat and drink,  set them free, all my beloved comrades &mdash;  let me feast my eyes.' </p>

<p>So 1 demanded.  Circe strode on through the halls and out,  her wand held high in hand and, flinging open the pens,  drove forth my men, who looked like full-grown swine.  Facing her, there they stood as she went along the ranks,  anointing them one by one with some new magic oil &mdash;  and look, the bristles grown by the first wicked drug  that Circe gave them slipped away from their limbs  and they turned men again: younger than ever,  taller by far, more handsome to the eye, and yes,  they knew me at once and each man grasped my hands  and a painful longing for tears overcame us all,  a terrible sobbing echoed through the house ...  The goddess herself was moved and, standing by me,  warmly urged me on &mdash; a lustrous goddess now: </p>

<p></p>

<p>'Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, tried and true,  go at once to your ship at the water's edge,  haul her straight up on the shore first  and stow your cargo and running gear in caves,  then back you come and bring your trusty crew.' </p>

<p>Her urging won my stubborn spirit over.  Down 1 went to the swift ship at the water's edge,  and there on the decks 1 found my loyal crew  consumed with grief and weeping live warm tears.  But now, as calves in stalls when cows come home,  droves of them herded back from field to farmyard  once they've grazed their fill &mdash; as all their young calves  come frisking out to meet them, bucking out of their pens,  lowing nonstop, jostling, rushing round their mothers &mdash;  so my shipmates there at the sight of my return  came pressing round me now, streaming tears,  so deeply moved in their hearts they felt as if  they'd made it back to their own land, their city,  Ithaca's rocky soil where they were bred and reared.  And through their tears their words went winging home:  'You're back again, my king! How thrilled we are &mdash;  as if we'd reached our country, Ithaca, at last!  But come, tell us about the fate our comrades met.' </p>

<p>Still I replied with a timely word of comfort:  'Let's haul our ship straight up on the shore first  and stow our cargo and running gear in caves.  Then hurry, all of you, come along with me  to see our friends in the magic halls of Circe,  eating and drinking &mdash; ^the feast flows on forever.' </p>

<p>So I said and they jumped to do my bidding.  Only Eurylochus tried to hold my shipmates back,  his mutinous outburst aimed at one and all:  'Poor fools, where are we running now?  Why are we tempting fate? &mdash;  why stumble blindly down to Circe's halls? </p>

<p></p>

<p>She'll turn us all into pigs or wolves or lions  made to guard that palace of hers &mdash; by force, 1 tell you &mdash;  just as the Cyclops trapped our comrades in his lair  with hotheaded Odysseus right beside them all &mdash;  thanks to this man's rashness t/iey died too!' </p>

<p>So he declared and 1 had half a mind  to draw the sharp sword from beside my hip  and slice his head off, tumbling down in the dust,  close kin that he was. But comrades checked me,  each man trying to calm me, left and right:  'Captain, we'll leave him here if you command,  just where he is, to sit and guard the ship.  Lead us on to the magic halls of Circe.' </p>

<p>With that, </p>

<p>up from the ship and shore they headed inland.  Nor did Eurylochus malinger by the hull;  he straggled behind the rest,  dreading the sharp blast of my rebuke. </p>

<p>All the while </p>

<p>Circe had bathed my other comrades in her palace, </p>

<p>caring and kindly, rubbed them sleek with oil </p>

<p>and decked them out in fleecy cloaks and shirts. </p>

<p>We found them all together, feasting in her halls. </p>

<p>Once we had recognized each other, gazing face-to-face, </p>

<p>we all broke down and wept &mdash; and the house resounded now </p>

<p>and Circe the lustrous one came toward me, pleading, </p>

<p>'Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, man of action, </p>

<p>no more tears now, calm these tides of sorrow. </p>

<p>Well 1 know what pains you bore on the swarming sea, </p>

<p>what punishment you endured from hostile men on land. </p>

<p>But come now, eat your food and drink your wine </p>

<p>till the same courage fills your chests, now as then, </p>

<p>when you first set sail from native land, from rocky Ithaca! </p>

<p>Now you are burnt-out husks, your spirits haggard, sere, </p>

<p>always brooding over your wanderings long and hard, </p>

<p>your hearts never lifting with any joy &mdash; </p>

<p>you've suffered far too much.' </p>

<p></p>

<p>So she enticed  and won our battle-hardened spirits over.  And there we sat at ease,  day in, day out, till a year had run its course,  feasting on sides of meat and drafts of heady wine ...  But then, when the year was through and the seasons wheeled by  and the months waned and the long days came round again,  my loyal comrades took me aside and prodded,  'Captain, this is madness! </p>

<p>High time you thought of your own home at last, </p>

<p>if it really z?your fate to make it back alive </p>

<p>and reach your well-built house and native land.' </p>

<p>Their urging brought my stubborn spirit round.  So all that day till the sun went down we sat  and feasted on sides of meat and heady wine.  Then when the sun had set and night came on  the men lay down to sleep in the shadowed halls  but 1 went up to that luxurious bed of Circe's,  hugged her by the knees </p>

<p>and the goddess heard my winging supplication:  'Circe, now make good a promise you gave me once &mdash;  it's time to help me home. My heart longs to be home,  my comrades' hearts as well. They wear me down,  pleading with me whenever you're away.' </p>

<p>So 1 pressed  and the lustrous goddess answered me in turn:  'Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, old campaigner,  stay on no more in my house against your will.  But first another journey calls. You must travel down  to the House of Death and the awesome one, Persephone,  there to consult the ghost of Tiresias, seer of Thebes,  the great blind prophet whose mind remains unshaken.  Even in death &mdash; Persephone has given him wisdom,  everlasting vision to him and him alone ...  the rest of the dead are empty, flitting shades.' </p>

<p></p>

<p>So she said and crushed the heart inside me.  I knelt in her bed and wept. I'd no desire  to go on living and see the rising light of day.  But once I'd had my fill of tears and writhing there,  at last I found the words to venture, Circe, Circe,  who can pilot us on that journey? Who has ever  reached the House of Death in a black ship?' </p>

<p>The lustrous goddess answered, never pausing,  'Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, born for exploits,  let no lack of a pilot at the helm concern you, no,  just step your mast and spread your white sail wide &mdash;  sit back and the North Wind will speed you on your way.  But once your vessel has cut across the Ocean River  you will raise a desolate coast and Persephone's Grove,  her tall black poplars, willows whose fruit dies young.  Beach your vessel hard by the Ocean's churning shore  and make your own way down to the moldering House of Death.  And there into Acheron, the Flood of Grief, two rivers flow,  the torrent River of Fire, the wailing River of Tears  that branches off from Styx, the Stream of Hate,  and a stark crag looms </p>

<p>where the two rivers thunder down and meet.  Once there, go forward, hero. Do as 1 say now.  Dig a trench of about a forearm's depth and length  and around it pour libations out to all the dead &mdash;  first with milk and honey, and then with mellow wine,  then water third and last, and sprinkle glistening barley  over it all, and vow again and again to all the dead,  to the drifting, listless spirits of their ghosts,  that once you return to Ithaca you will slaughter  a barren heifer in your halls, the best you have,  and load a pyre with treasures &mdash; and to Tiresias,  alone, apart, you will offer a sleek black ram,  the pride of all your herds. And once your prayers  have invoked the nations of the dead in their dim glory,  slaughter a ram and black ewe, turning both their heads  toward Erebus, but turn your head away, looking toward  the Ocean River. Suddenly then the countless shades </p>

<p></p>

<p>of the dead and gone will surge around you there.  But order your men at once to flay the sheep  that lie before you, killed by your ruthless blade,  and burn them both, and then say prayers to the gods,  to the almighty god of death and dread Persephone.  But you &mdash; draw your sharp sword from beside your hip,  sit down on alert there, and never let the ghosts  of the shambling, shiftless dead come near that blood  till you have questioned Tiresias yourself. Soon, soon  the great seer will appear before you, captain of armies:  he will tell you the way to go, the stages of your voyage,  how you can cross the swarming sea and reach home at last.' </p>

<p>And with those words Dawn rose on her golden throne  and Circe dressed me quickly in sea-cloak and shirt  while the queen slipped on a loose, glistening robe,  filmy, a joy to the eye, and round her waist  she ran a brocaded golden belt  and over her head a scarf to shield her brow.  And 1 strode on through the halls to stir my men,  hovering over each with a winning word: 'Up now!  No more lazing away in sleep, we must set sail &mdash;  Queen Circe has shown the way . ' </p>

<p>1 brought them round,  my hardy friends-in-arms, but not even from there  could 1 get them safely off without a loss ...  There was a man, Elpenor, the youngest in our ranks,  none too brave in battle, none too sound in mind.  He'd strayed from his mates in Circe's magic halls  and keen for the cool night air,  sodden with wine he'd bedded down on her roofs.  But roused by the shouts and tread of marching men,  he leapt up with a start at dawn but still so dazed  he forgot to climb back down again by the long ladder &mdash;  headfirst from the roof he plunged, his neck snapped  from the backbone, his soul flew down to Death. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Once on our way, I gave the men their orders:  'You think we are headed home, our own dear land?  Well, Circe sets us a rather different course ...  down to the House of Death and the awesome one, Persephone,  there to consult the ghost of Tiresias, seer of Thebes. ' </p>

<p>So 1 said, and it broke my shipmates' hearts.  They sank down on the ground, moaning, tore their hair.  But it gained us nothing &mdash; what good can come of grief? </p>

<p>Back to the swift ship at the water's edge we went,  our spirits deep in anguish, faces wet with tears.  But Circe got to the dark hull before us,  tethered a ram and black ewe close by &mdash;  slipping past unseen. Who can glimpse a god  who wants to be invisible gliding here and there?&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>Book XI </p>

<p></p>

<p>The Kingdom of  the Dead </p>

<p>&quot;Now down we came to the ship at the water's edge, </p>

<p>we hauled and launched her into the sunlit breakers first, </p>

<p>stepped the mast in the black craft and set our sail </p>

<p>and loaded the sheep aboard, the ram and ewe, </p>

<p>then we ourselves embarked, streaming tears, </p>

<p>our hearts weighed down with anguish ... </p>

<p>But Circe the awesome nymph with lovely braids </p>

<p>who speaks with human voice, sent us a hardy shipmate, </p>

<p>yes, a fresh following wind ruffling up in our wake, </p>

<p>bellying out our sail to drive our blue prow on as we, </p>

<p>securing the running gear from stem to stern, sat back </p>

<p>while the wind and helmsman kept her true on course. </p>

<p>The sail stretched taut as she cut the sea all day </p>

<p>and the sun sank and the roads of the world grew dark. </p>

<p></p>

<p>And she made the outer limits, the Ocean River's bounds  where Cimmerian people have their homes &mdash; their realm and city  shrouded in mist and cloud. The eye of the Sun can never  flash his rays through the dark and bring them light,  not when he climbs the starry skies or when he wheels  back down from the heights to touch the earth once more &mdash;  an endless, deadly night overhangs those wretched men.  There, gaining that point, we beached our craft  and herding out the sheep, we picked our way  by the Ocean's banks until we gained the place  that Circe made our goal. </p>

<p>Here at the spot  Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims fast,  and 1, drawing my sharp sword from beside my hip,  dug a trench of about a forearm's depth and length  and around it poured libations out to all the dead,  first with milk and honey, and then with mellow wine,  then water third and last, and sprinkled glistening barley  over it all, and time and again 1 vowed to all the dead,  to the drifting, listless spirits of their ghosts,  that once 1 returned to Ithaca 1 would slaughter  a barren heifer in my halls, the best 1 had,  and load a pyre with treasures &mdash; and to Tiresias,  alone, apart, 1 would offer a sleek black ram,  the pride of all my herds. And once my vows  and prayers had invoked the nations of the dead,  1 took the victims, over the trench 1 cut their throats  and the dark blood flowed in &mdash; and up out of Erebus they came,  flocking toward me now, the ghosts of the dead and gone ...  Brides and unwed youths and old men who had suffered much  and girls with their tender hearts freshly scarred by sorrow  and great armies of battle dead, stabbed by bronze spears,  men of war still wrapped in bloody armor &mdash; ^thousands  swarming around the trench from every side &mdash;  unearthly cries &mdash; blanching terror gripped me!  1 ordered the men at once to flay the sheep  that lay before us, killed by my ruthless blade. </p>

<p></p>

<p>and burn them both, and then say prayers to the gods,  to the almighty god of death and dread Persephone.  But I, the sharp sword drawn from beside my hip,  sat down on alert there and never let the ghosts  of the shambling, shiftless dead come near that blood  till 1 had questioned Tiresias myself. </p>

<p>But first </p>

<p>the ghost of Elpenor, my companion, came toward me.  He'd not been buried under the wide ways of earth,  not yet, we'd left his body in Circe's house,  unwept, unburied &mdash; this other labor pressed us.  But 1 wept to see him now, pity touched my heart  and 1 called out a winged word to him there: Elpenor,  how did you travel down to the world of darkness?  Faster on foot, 1 see, than 1 in my black ship.' </p>

<p>My comrade groaned as he offered me an answer:  Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, old campaigner,  the doom of an angry god, and god knows how much wine &mdash;  they were my ruin, captain ... I'd bedded down  on the roof of Circe's house but never thought  to climb back down again by the long ladder &mdash;  headfirst from the roof 1 plunged, my neck snapped  from the backbone, my soul flew down to Death. Now,  1 beg you by those you left behind, so far from here,  your wife, your father who bred and reared you as a boy,  and Telemachus, left at home in your halls, your only son.  Well 1 know when you leave this lodging of the dead  that you and your ship will put ashore again  at the island of Aeaea &mdash; ^then and there,  my lord, remember me, 1 beg you! Don't sail off  and desert me, left behind unwept, unburied, don't,  or my curse may draw god's fury on your head.  No, burn me in full armor, all my harness,  heap my mound by the churning gray surf &mdash;  a man whose luck ran out &mdash;  so even men to come will learn my story. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Perform my rites, and plant on my tomb that oar  I swung with mates when I rowed among the living. ' </p>

<p>'All this, my unlucky friend,' 1 reassured him,  '1 will do for you. 1 won't forget a thing.' </p>

<p>So we sat </p>

<p>and faced each other, trading our bleak parting words,  1 on my side, holding my sword above the blood,  he across from me there, my comrade's phantom  dragging out his story. </p>

<p>But look, the ghost  of my mother came, my mother, dead and gone now ...  Anticleia &mdash; daughter of that great heart Autolycus &mdash;  whom 1 had left alive when 1 sailed for sacred Troy.  1 broke into tears to see her here, but filled with pity,  even throbbing with grief, 1 would not let her ghost  approach the blood till 1 had questioned Tiresias myself. </p>

<p>At last he came. The shade of the famous Theban prophet,  holding a golden scepter, knew me at once and hailed me:  'Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, master of exploits,  man of pain, what now, what brings you here,  forsaking the light of day  to see this joyless kingdom of the dead?  Stand back from the trench &mdash; put up your sharp sword  so 1 can drink the blood and tell you all the truth.' </p>

<p>Moving back, 1 thrust my silver-studded sword  deep in its sheath, and once he had drunk the dark blood  the words came ringing from the prophet in his power:  'A sweet smooth journey home, renowned Odysseus,  that is what you seek, </p>

<p>but a god will make it hard for you &mdash; 1 know &mdash;  you will never escape the one who shakes the earth,  quaking with anger at you still, still enraged  because you blinded the Cyclops, his dear son.  Even so, you and your crew may still reach home,  suffering all the way, if you only have the power </p>

<p></p>

<p>to curb their wild desire and curb your own, what's more, </p>

<p>from the day your good trim vessel first puts in </p>

<p>at Thrinacia Island, flees the cruel blue sea. </p>

<p>There you will find them grazing, </p>

<p>herds and fat flocks, the cattle of Helios, </p>

<p>god of the sun who sees all, hears all things. </p>

<p>Leave the beasts unharmed, your mind set on home, </p>

<p>and you a//may still reach Ithaca &mdash; bent with hardship, </p>

<p>true &mdash; but harm them in any way, and 1 can see it now: </p>

<p>your ship destroyed, your men destroyed as well. </p>

<p>And even if you escape, you'll come home late </p>

<p>and come a broken man &mdash; all shipmates lost, </p>

<p>alone in a stranger's ship &mdash; </p>

<p>and you will find a world of pain at home, </p>

<p>crude, arrogant men devouring all your goods, </p>

<p>courting your noble wife, offering gifts to win her. </p>

<p>No doubt you will pay them back in blood when you come home! </p>

<p>But once you have killed those suitors in your halls &mdash; </p>

<p>by stealth or in open fight with slashing bronze &mdash; </p>

<p>go forth once more, you must ... </p>

<p>carry your well-planed oar until you come </p>

<p>to a race of people who know nothing of the sea, </p>

<p>whose food is never seasoned with salt, strangers all </p>

<p>to ships with their crimson prows and long slim oars, </p>

<p>wings that make ships fly. And here is your sign &mdash; </p>

<p>unmistakable, clear, so clear you cannot miss it: </p>

<p>When another traveler falls in with you and calls </p>

<p>that weight across your shoulder a fan to winnow grain, </p>

<p>then plant your bladed, balanced oar in the earth </p>

<p>and sacrifice fine beasts to the lord god of the sea, </p>

<p>Poseidon &mdash; a ram, a bull and a ramping wild boar &mdash; </p>

<p>then journey home and render noble offerings up </p>

<p>to the deathless gods who rule the vaulting skies, </p>

<p>to all the gods in order. </p>

<p>And at last your own death will steal upon you ... </p>

<p>a gentle, painless death, far from the sea it comes </p>

<p>to take you down, borne down with the years in ripe old age </p>

<p>with all your people there in blessed peace around you. </p>

<p></p>

<p>All that 1 have told you will come true. ' </p>

<p>'OhTiresias/  1 replied as the prophet finished, surely the gods  have spun this out as fate, the gods themselves.  But tell me one thing more, and tell me clearly.  1 see the ghost of my long-lost mother here before me.  Dead, crouching close to the blood in silence,  she cannot bear to look me in the eyes &mdash;  her own son &mdash; or speak a word to me. How,  lord, can 1 make her know me for the man 1 am?' </p>

<p>'One rule there is,' the famous seer explained,  and simple for me to say and you to learn.  Any one of the ghosts you let approach the blood  will speak the truth to you. Anyone you refuse  will turn and fade away.' </p>

<p>And with those words,  now that his prophecies had closed, the awesome shade  of lord Tiresias strode back to the House of Death.  But 1 kept watch there, steadfast till my mother  approached and drank the dark, clouding blood.  She knew me at once and wailed out in grief  and her words came winging toward me, flying home:  'Oh my son &mdash; what brings you down to the world  of death and darkness? You are still alive!  It's hard for the living to catch a glimpse of this ...  Great rivers flow between us, terrible waters,  the Ocean first of all &mdash; no one could ever ford  that stream on foot, only aboard some sturdy craft.  Have you just come from Troy, wandering long years  with your men and ship? Not yet returned to Ithaca?  You've still not seen your wife inside your halls?' </p>

<p>'Mother,' </p>

<p>1 replied, '1 had to venture down to the House of Death,  to consult the shade of Tiresias, seer of Thebes.  Never yet have 1 neared Achaea, never once  set foot on native ground, </p>

<p>always wandering &mdash; endless hardship from that day </p>

<p></p>

<p>I first set sail with King Agamemnon bound for Troy, </p>

<p>the stallion-land, to fight the Trojans there. </p>

<p>But tell me about yourself and spare me nothing. </p>

<p>What form of death overcame you, what laid you low, </p>

<p>some long slow illness? Or did Artemis showering arrows </p>

<p>come with her painless shafts and bring you down? </p>

<p>Tell me of father, tell of the son 1 left behind: </p>

<p>do my royal rights still lie in their safekeeping? </p>

<p>Or does some stranger hold the throne by now </p>

<p>because men think that I'll come home no more? </p>

<p>Please, tell me about my wife, her turn of mind, </p>

<p>her thoughts ... still standing fast beside our son, </p>

<p>still guarding our great estates, secure as ever now? </p>

<p>Or has she wed some other countryman at last, </p>

<p>the finest prince among them?' </p>

<p>'Surely, surely,'  my noble mother answered quickly, she's still waiting  there in your halls, poor woman, suffering so,  her life an endless hardship like your own ...  wasting away the nights, weeping away the days.  No one has taken over your royal rights, not yet.  Telemachus still holds your great estates in peace,  he attends the public banquets shared with all,  the feasts a man of justice should enjoy,  for every lord invites him. As for your father,  he keeps to his own farm &mdash; he never goes to town &mdash;  with no bed for him there, no blankets, glossy throws;  all winter long he sleeps in the lodge with servants,  in the ashes by the fire, his body wrapped in rags.  But when summer comes and the bumper crops of harvest,  any spot on the rising ground of his vineyard rows  he makes his bed, heaped high with fallen leaves,  and there he lies in anguish ...  with his old age bearing hard upon him, too,  and his grief grows as he longs for your return.  And 1 with the same grief, 1 died and met my fate.  No sharp-eyed Huntress showering arrows through the halls  approached and brought me down with painless shafts. </p>

<p></p>

<p>nor did some hateful illness strike me, that so often  devastates the body, drains our limbs of power.  No, it was my longing for you, my shining Odysseus &mdash;  you and your quickness, you and your gentle ways &mdash;  that tore away my life that had been sweet.' </p>

<p>And 1, my mind in turmoil, how 1 longed  to embrace my mother's spirit, dead as she was!  Three times 1 rushed toward her, desperate to hold her,  three times she fluttered through my fingers, sifting away  like a shadow, dissolving like a dream, and each time  the grief cut to the heart, sharper, yes, and 1,  1 cried out to her, words winging into the darkness:  'Mother &mdash; why not wait for me? How 1 long to hold you! &mdash;  so even here, in the House of Death, we can fling  our loving arms around each other, take some joy  in the tears that numb the heart. Or is this just  some wraith that great Persephone sends my way  to make me ache with sorrow all the more?' </p>

<p>My noble mother answered me at once:  'My son, my son, the unluckiest man alive!  This is no deception sent by Queen Persephone,  this is just the way of mortals when we die.  Sinews no longer bind the flesh and bones together &mdash;  the fire in all its fury burns the body down to ashes  once life slips from the white bones, and the spirit,  rustling, flitters away ... flown like a dream.  But you must long for the daylight. Go, quickly.  Remember all these things  so one day you can tell them to your wife. ' </p>

<p>And so we both confided, trading parting words,  and there slowly came a grand array of women,  all sent before me now by august Persephone,  and all were wives and daughters once of princes.  They swarmed in a flock around the dark blood  while 1 searched for a way to question each alone. </p>

<p></p>

<p>and the more I thought, the more this seemed the best:  Drawing forth the long sharp sword from beside my hip,  I would not let them drink the dark blood, all in a rush,  and so they waited, coming forward one after another.  Each declared her lineage, and 1 explored them all. </p>

<p>And the first 1 saw there? Tyro, born of kings,  who said her father was that great lord Salmoneus,  said that she was the wife of Cretheus, Aeolus' son.  And once she fell in love with the river god, Enipeus,  far the clearest river flowing across the earth,  and so she'd haunt Enipeus' glinting streams,  till taking his shape one day  the god who girds the earth and makes it tremble  bedded her where the swirling river rushes out to sea,  and a surging wave reared up, high as a mountain, dark,  arching over to hide the god and mortal girl together.  Loosing her virgin belt, he lapped her round in sleep  and when the god had consummated his work of love  he took her by the hand and hailed her warmly:  'Rejoice in our love, my lady! And when this year  has run its course you will give birth to glorious children &mdash;  bedding down with the gods is never barren, futile &mdash;  and you must tend them, breed and rear them well.  Now home you go, and restrain yourself, 1 say,  never breathe your lover's name but know &mdash;  1 am Poseidon, god who rocks the earth!' </p>

<p>With that he dove back in the heaving waves  and she conceived for the god and bore him Pelias, Neleus,  and both grew up to be stalwart aides of Zeus almighty,  both men alike. Pelias lived on the plains of lolcos,  rich in sheepflocks, Neleus lived in sandy Pylos.  And the noble queen bore sons to Cretheus too:  Aeson, Pheres and Amy thaon, exultant charioteer. </p>

<p>And after Tyro 1 saw Asopus' daughter Antiope,  proud she'd spent a night in the arms of Zeus himself </p>

<p></p>

<p>and borne the god twin sons, Amphion and Zethus,  the first to build the footings of seven-gated Thebes,  her bastions too, for lacking ramparts none could live  in a place so vast, so open &mdash; strong as both men were. </p>

<p>And 1 saw Alcmena next, Amphitryon's wife,  who slept in the clasp of Zeus and merged in love  and brought forth Heracles, rugged will and lion heart.  And 1 saw Megara too, magnanimous Creon's daughter  wed to the stalwart Heracles, the hero never daunted. </p>

<p>And 1 saw the mother of Oedipus, beautiful Epicaste.  What a monstrous thing she did, in all innocence &mdash;  she married her own son ...  who'd killed his father, then he married her!  But the gods soon made it known to all mankind.  So he in growing pain ruled on in beloved Thebes,  lording Cadmus' people &mdash; thanks to the gods' brutal plan &mdash;  while she went down to Death who guards the massive gates.  Lashing a noose to a steep rafter, there she hanged aloft,  strangling in all her anguish, leaving her son to bear  the world of horror a mother's Furies bring to life. </p>

<p>And 1 saw magnificent Chloris, the one whom Neleus  wooed and won with a hoard of splendid gifts,  so dazzled by her beauty years ago ...  the youngest daughter of lasus' son Amphion,  the great Minyan king who ruled Orchomenos once.  She was his queen in Pylos, she bore him shining sons,  Nestor and Chromius, Periclymenus too, good prince.  And after her sons she bore a daughter, majestic Pero,  the marvel of her time, courted by all the young lords  round about. But Neleus would not give her to any suitor,  none but the man who might drive home the herds  that powerful Iphiclus had stolen. Lurching,  broad in the brow, those longhorned beasts,  and no small task to round them up from Phylace. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Only the valiant seer Melampus volunteered &mdash; </p>

<p>would drive them home &mdash;  but a god's iron sentence bound him fast:  barbarous herdsmen dragged him off in chains.  Yet when the months and days had run their course  and the year wheeled round and the seasons came again,  then mighty Iphiclus loosed the prophet's shackles,  once he had told him all the gods' decrees.  And so the will of Zeus was done at last. </p>

<p>And 1 saw Leda next, Tyndareus' wife,  who'd borne the king two sons, intrepid twins.  Castor, breaker of horses, and the hardy boxer Polydeuces,  both buried now in the life-giving earth though still alive.  Even under the earth Zeus grants them that distinction:  one day alive, the next day dead, each twin by turns,  they both hold honors equal to the gods'. </p>

<p>And 1 saw Iphimedeia next, Aloeus' wife,  who claimed she lay in the Sea-lord's loving waves  and gave the god two sons, but they did not live long,  Otus staunch as a god and far-famed Ephialtes.  They were the tallest men the fertile earth has borne,  the handsomest too, by far, aside from renowned Orion.  Nine yards across they measured, even at nine years old,  nine fathoms tall they towered. They even threatened  the deathless gods they'd storm Olympus' heights  with the pounding rush and grinding shock of battle.  They were wild to pile Ossa upon Olympus, then on Ossa  Pelion dense with timber &mdash; their toeholds up the heavens.  And they'd have won the day if they had reached peak strength  but Apollo the son of Zeus, whom sleek-haired Leto bore,  laid both low before their beards had sprouted,  covering cheek and chin with a fresh crop of down. </p>

<p>Phaedra and Procris too 1 saw, and lovely Ariadne,  daughter of Minos, that harsh king. One day Theseus tried </p>

<p></p>

<p>to spirit her off from Crete to Athens' sacred heights,  but he got no joy from her. Artemis killed her first  on wave-washed Dia's shores, accused by Dionysus. </p>

<p>And 1 saw Clymene, Maera and loathsome Eriphyle &mdash;  bribed with a golden necklace  to lure her lawful husband to his death ...  But the whole cortege 1 could never tally, never name,  not all the daughters and wives of great men 1 saw there.  Long before that, the godsent night would ebb away.  But the time has come for sleep, either with friends  aboard your swift ship or here in your own house.  My passage home will rest with the gods and you.&quot; </p>

<p>Odysseus paused ... They all fell silent, hushed,  his story holding them spellbound down the shadowed halls  till the white-armed queen Arete suddenly burst out,  &quot;Phaeacians! How does this man impress you now,  his looks, his build, the balanced mind inside him?  The stranger is my guest  but each of you princes shares the honor here.  So let's not be too hasty to send him on his way,  and don't scrimp on his gifts. His need is great,  great as the riches piled up in your houses,  thanks to the gods' good will.&quot; </p>

<p>Following her, </p>

<p>the old revered Echeneus added his support,  the eldest lord on the island of Phaeacia:  &quot;Friends, the words of our considerate queen &mdash;  they never miss the mark or fail our expectations.  So do as Arete says, though on Alcinous here  depend all words and action.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;And so it will be&quot;&mdash;  Alcinous stepped in grandly &mdash; &quot;sure as 1 am alive  and rule our island men who love their oars!  Our guest, much as he longs for passage home,  must stay and wait it out here till tomorrow,  till 1 can collect his whole array of parting gifts. </p>

<p></p>

<p>His send-off rests with every noble here </p>

<p>but with me most of all: </p>

<p>1 hold the reins of power in the realm. &quot; </p>

<p>Odysseus, deft and tactful, echoed back,  &quot;Alcinous, majesty, shining among your island people,  if you would urge me now to stay here one whole year  then speed me home weighed down with lordly gifts,  I'd gladly have it so. Better by far, I'd say.  The fuller my arms on landing there at home,  the more respected, well-received I'd be  by all who saw me sailing back to Ithaca.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ah Odysseus, &quot; Alcinous replied, &quot;one look at you  and we know that you are no one who would cheat us &mdash;  no fraud, such as the dark soil breeds and spreads  across the face of the earth these days. Crowds of vagabonds  frame their lies so tightly none can test them. But you,  what grace you give your words, and what good sense within!  You have told your story with all a singer's skill,  the miseries you endured, your great Achaeans too.  But come now, tell me truly: your godlike comrades &mdash;  did you see any heroes down in the House of Death,  any who sailed with you and met their doom at Troy?  The night's still young, I'd say the night is endless.  For us in the palace now, it's hardly time for sleep.  Keep telling us your adventures &mdash; ^they are wonderful.  1 could hold out here till Dawn's first light  if only you could bear, here in our halls,  to tell the tale of all the pains you suffered. &quot; </p>

<p>So the man of countless exploits carried on:  &quot;Alcinous, majesty, shining among your island people,  there is a time for many words, a time for sleep as well.  But if you insist on hearing more, I'd never stint  on telling my own tale and those more painful still,  the griefs of my comrades, dead in the war's wake,  who escaped the battle-cries of Trojan armies </p>

<p></p>

<p>only to die in blood at journey's end &mdash;  thanks to a vicious woman's will. </p>

<p>Now then, </p>

<p>no sooner had Queen Persephone driven off </p>

<p>the ghosts of lovely women, scattering left and right, </p>

<p>than forward marched the shade of Atreus' son Agamemnon, </p>

<p>fraught with grief and flanked by all his comrades, </p>

<p>troops of his men-at-arms who died beside him, </p>

<p>who met their fate in lord Aegisthus' halls. </p>

<p>He knew me at once, as soon as he drank the blood, </p>

<p>and wailed out, shrilly; tears sprang to his eyes, </p>

<p>he thrust his arms toward me, keen to embrace me there &mdash; </p>

<p>no use &mdash; the great force was gone, the strength lost forever, </p>

<p>now, that filled his rippling limbs in the old days. </p>

<p>1 wept at the sight, my heart went out to the man, </p>

<p>my words too, in a winging flight of pity: </p>

<p>'Famous Atrides, lord of men Agamemnon! </p>

<p>What fatal stroke of destiny brought you down? </p>

<p>Wrecked in the ships when lord Poseidon roused </p>

<p>some punishing blast of stormwinds, gust on gust? </p>

<p>Or did ranks of enemies mow you down on land </p>

<p>as you tried to raid and cut off herds and flocks </p>

<p>or fought to win their city, take their women?' </p>

<p>The field marshal's ghost replied at once:  'Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, mastermind of war,  1 was not wrecked in the ships when lord Poseidon  roused some punishing blast of stormwinds, gust on gust,  nor did ranks of enemies mow me down on land &mdash;  Aegisthus hatched my doom and my destruction, </p>

<p>killed me, he with my own accursed wife ...  he invited me to his palace, sat me down to feast  then cut me down as a man cuts down some ox at the trough!  So 1 died &mdash; a wretched, ignominious death &mdash; and round me  all my comrades killed, no mercy, one after another,  just like white-tusked boars  butchered in some rich lord of power's halls </p>

<p></p>

<p>for a wedding, banquet or groaning public feast.  You in your day have witnessed hundreds slaughtered,  killed in single combat or killed in pitched battle, true,  but if you'd laid eyes on thisiX. would have wrenched your heart-  how we sprawled by the mixing-bowl and loaded tables there,  throughout the palace, the whole floor awash with blood.  But the death-shriek of Cassandra, Priam's daughter &mdash;  most pitiful thing 1 heard! My treacherous queen,  Clytemnestra, killed her over my body, yes, and 1,  lifting my fists, beat them down on the ground,  dying, dying, writhing around the sword.  But she, that whore, she turned her back on me,  well on my way to Death &mdash; she even lacked the heart  to seal my eyes with her hand or close my jaws. </p>

<p>So, </p>

<p>there's nothing more deadly, bestial than a woman  set on works like these &mdash; what a monstrous thing  she plotted, slaughtered her own lawful husband!  Why, 1 expected, at least, some welcome home  from all my children, all my household slaves  when 1 came sailing back again ... But she &mdash;  the queen hell-bent on outrage &mdash; bathes in shame  not only herself but the whole breed of womankind,  even the honest ones to come, forever down the years!' </p>

<p>So he declared and 1 cried out, 'How terrible!  Zeus from the very start, the thunder king  has hated the race of Atreus with a vengeance &mdash;  his trustiest weapon women's twisted wiles.  What armies of us died for the sake of Helen ...  Clytemnestra schemed your death while you were worlds away!' </p>

<p>'True, true,' Agamemnon's ghost kept pressing on,  'so even your own wife &mdash; never indulge her too far.  Never reveal the whole truth, whatever you may know;  just tell her a part of it, be sure to hide the rest.  Not that you, Odysseus, will be murdered by your wife. </p>

<p></p>

<p>She's much too steady, her feeUngs run too deep, </p>

<p>Icarius' daughter Penelope, that wise woman. </p>

<p>She was a young bride, I well remember ... </p>

<p>we left her behind when we went off to war, </p>

<p>with an infant boy she nestled at her breast. </p>

<p>That boy must sit and be counted with the men now &mdash; </p>

<p>happy man! His beloved father will come sailing home </p>

<p>and see his son, and he will embrace his father, </p>

<p>that is only right. But myv^iie &mdash; she never </p>

<p>even let me feast my eyes on my own son; </p>

<p>she killed me first, his father! </p>

<p>1 tell you this &mdash; bear it in mind, you must &mdash; </p>

<p>when you reach your homeland steer your ship </p>

<p>into port in secret, never out in the open ... </p>

<p>the time for trusting women's gone forever! </p>

<p>Enough. Come, tell me this, and be precise.  Have you heard news of my son? Where's he living now?  Perhaps in Orchomenos, perhaps in sandy Pylos  or off in the Spartan plains with Menelaus?  He's not dead yet, my Prince Orestes, no,  he's somewhere on the earth.' </p>

<p>So he probed </p>

<p>but 1 cut it short: 'Atrides, why ask me that?  1 know nothing, whether he's dead or alive.  It's wrong to lead you on with idle words. ' </p>

<p>So we stood there, trading heartsick stories,  deep in grief, as the tears streamed down our faces.  But now there came the ghosts of Peleus' son Achilles,  Patroclus, fearless Antilochus &mdash; and Great Ajax too,  the first in stature, first in build and bearing  of all the Argives after Peleus' matchless son.  The ghost of the splendid runner knew me at once  and hailed me with a flight of mournful questions:  'Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, man of tactics,  reckless friend, what next? </p>

<p></p>

<p>What greater feat can that cunning head contrive? </p>

<p>What daring brought you down to the House of Death? &mdash; </p>

<p>where the senseless, burnt-out wraiths of mortals make their home.' </p>

<p>The voice of his spirit paused, and 1 was quick to answer:  'Achilles, son of Peleus, greatest of the Achaeans,  1 had to consult Tiresias, driven here by hopes  he would help me journey home to rocky Ithaca.  Never yet have 1 neared Achaea, never once  set foot on native ground ...  my life is endless trouble. </p>

<p>But you, Achilles,  there's not a man in the world more blest than you &mdash;  there never has been, never will be one.  Time was, when you were alive, we Argives  honored you as a god, and now down here, 1 see,  you lord it over the dead in all your power.  So grieve no more at dying, great Achilles.' </p>

<p>1 reassured the ghost, but he broke out, protesting,  'No winning words about death to me, shining Odysseus!  By god, I'd rather slave on earth for another man &mdash;  some dirt-poor tenant farmer who scrapes to keep alive &mdash;  than rule down here over all the breathless dead.  But come, tell me the news about my gallant son.  Did he make his way to the wars,  did the boy become a champion &mdash; yes or no?  Tell me of noble Peleus, any word you've heard &mdash;  still holding pride of place among his Myrmidon hordes,  or do they despise the man in Hellas and in Phthia  because old age has lamed his arms and legs?  For 1 no longer stand in the light of day &mdash;  the man 1 was &mdash; comrade-in-arms to help my father  as once 1 helped our armies, killing the best fighters  Troy could field in the wide world up there ...  Oh to arrive at father's house &mdash; ^the man I was,  for one brief day &mdash; I'd make my fury and my hands. </p>

<p></p>

<p>invincible hands, a thing of terror to all those men </p>

<p>who abuse the king with force and wrest away his honor!' </p>

<p>So he grieved but 1 tried to lend him heart:  About noble Peleus 1 can tell you nothing,  but about your own dear son, Neoptolemus,  1 can report the whole story, as you wish.  1 myself, in my trim ship, 1 brought him  out of Scyros to join the Argives under arms.  And dug in around Troy, debating battle-tactics,  he always spoke up first, and always on the mark &mdash;  godlike Nestor and 1 alone excelled the boy. Yes,  and when our armies fought on the plain of Troy  he'd never hang back with the main force of men &mdash;  he'd always charge ahead,  giving ground to no one in his fury,  and scores of men he killed in bloody combat.  How could 1 list them all, name them all, now,  the fighting ranks he leveled, battling for the Argives?  But what a soldier he laid low with a bronze sword:  the hero Eurypylus, Telephus' son, and round him  troops of his own Cetean comrades slaughtered,  lured to war by the bribe his mother took.  The only man 1 saw to put Eurypylus  in the shade was Memnon, son of the Morning.  Again, when our champions climbed inside the horse  that Epeus built with labor, and 1 held full command  to spring our packed ambush open or keep it sealed,  all our lords and captains were wiping off their tears,  knees shaking beneath each man &mdash; but not your son.  Never once did 1 see his glowing skin go pale;  he never flicked a tear from his cheeks, no,  he kept on begging me there to let him burst  from the horse, kept gripping his hilted sword,  his heavy bronze- tipped javelin, keen to loose  his fighting fury against the Trojans. Then,  once we'd sacked King Priam's craggy city,  laden with his fair share and princely prize </p>

<p></p>

<p>he boarded his own ship, his body all unscarred.  Not a wound from a flying spear or a sharp sword,  cut-and-thrust close up &mdash; the common marks of war.  Random, raging Ares plays no favorites.' </p>

<p>So 1 said and </p>

<p>off he went, the ghost of the great runner, Aeacus' grandson  loping with long strides across the fields of asphodel,  triumphant in all 1 had told him of his son,  his gallant, glorious son. </p>

<p>Now the rest of the ghosts, the dead and gone  came swarming up around me &mdash; deep in sorrow there,  each asking about the grief that touched him most.  Only the ghost of Great Ajax, son of Telamon,  kept his distance, blazing with anger at me still  for the victory 1 had won by the ships that time  1 pressed my claim for the arms of Prince Achilles.  His queenly mother had set them up as prizes,  Pallas and captive Trojans served as judges.  Would to god I'd never won such trophies!  All for them the earth closed over Ajax,  that proud hero Ajax ...  greatest in build, greatest in works of war  of all the Argives after Peleus' matchless son.  1 cried out to him now, 1 tried to win him over:  'Ajax, son of noble Telamon, still determined,  even in death, not once to forget that rage  you train on me for those accursed arms?  The gods set up that prize to plague the Achaeans &mdash;  so great a tower of strength we lost when you went down!  For your death we grieved as we did for Achilles' death &mdash;  we grieved incessantly, true, and none's to blame  but Zeus, who hated Achaea's fighting spearmen  so intensely, Zeus sealed your doom.  Come closer, king, and listen to my story.  Conquer your rage, your blazing, headstrong pride!' </p>

<p></p>

<p>So I cried out but Ajax answered not a word.  He stalked off toward Erebus, into the dark  to join the other lost, departed dead.  Yet now, despite his anger,  he might have spoken to me, or I to him,  but the heart inside me stirred with some desire  to see the ghosts of others dead and gone. </p>

<p>And I saw Minos there, illustrious son of Zeus,  firmly enthroned, holding his golden scepter,  judging all the dead ... </p>

<p>Some on their feet, some seated, all clustering  round the king of justice, pleading for his verdicts  reached in the House of Death with its all-embracing gates. </p>

<p>1 next caught sight of Orion, that huge hunter,  rounding up on the fields of asphodel those wild beasts  the man in life cut down on the lonely mountain-slopes,  brandishing in his hands the bronze-studded club  that time can never shatter. </p>

<p>1 saw Tityus too,  son of the mighty goddess Earth &mdash; sprawling there  on the ground, spread over nine acres &mdash; ^two vultures  hunched on either side of him, digging into his liver,  beaking deep in the blood-sac, and he with his frantic hands  could never beat them off, for he had once dragged off  the famous consort of Zeus in all her glory,  Leto, threading her way toward Pytho's ridge,  over the lovely dancing-rings of Panopeus. </p>

<p>And 1 saw Tantalus too, bearing endless torture.  He stood erect in a pool as the water lapped his chin &mdash;  parched, he burned to drink, but he could not reach the surface,  no, time and again the old man stooped, craving a sip,  time and again the water vanished, swallowed down,  laying bare the caked black earth at his feet &mdash;  some spirit drank it dry. And over his head  leafy trees dangled their fruit from high aloft,  pomegranates and pears, and apples glowing red. </p>

<p></p>

<p>succulent figs and olives swelling sleek and dark, </p>

<p>but soon as the old man would strain to clutch them fast </p>

<p>a gust would toss them up to the lowering dark clouds. </p>

<p>And 1 saw Sisyphus too, bound to his own torture,  grappling his monstrous boulder with both arms working,  heaving, hands struggling, legs driving, he kept on  thrusting the rock uphill toward the brink, but just  as it teetered, set to topple over &mdash; </p>

<p>time and again  the immense weight of the thing would wheel it back and  the ruthless boulder would bound and tumble down to the plain again &mdash;  so once again he would heave, would struggle to thrust it up,  sweat drenching his body, dust swirling above his head. </p>

<p>And next 1 caught a glimpse of powerful Heracles &mdash;  his ghost, 1 mean: the man himself delights  in the grand feasts of the deathless gods on high,  wed to Hebe, famed for her lithe, alluring ankles,  the daughter of mighty Zeus and Hera shod in gold.  Around him cries of the dead rang out like cries of birds,  scattering left and right in horror as on he came like night,  naked bow in his grip, an arrow grooved on the bowstring,  glaring round him fiercely, forever poised to shoot.  A terror too, that sword-belt sweeping across his chest,  a baldric of solid gold emblazoned with awesome work ...  bears and ramping boars and lions with wild, fiery eyes,  and wars, routs and battles, massacres, butchered men.  May the craftsman who forged that masterpiece &mdash;  whose skills could conjure up a belt like that &mdash;  never forge another! </p>

<p>Heracles knew me at once, at first glance, </p>

<p>and hailed me with a winging burst of pity: </p>

<p>'Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus famed for exploits, </p>

<p>luckless man, you too? Braving out a fate as harsh </p>

<p>as the fate 1 bore, alive in the light of day? </p>

<p>Son of Zeus that 1 was, my torments never ended, </p>

<p>forced to slave for a man not half the man 1 was: </p>

<p></p>

<p>he saddled me with the worst heartbreaking labors.  Why, he sent me down here once, to retrieve the hound  that guards the dead &mdash; no harder task for me, he thought &mdash;  but 1 dragged the great beast up from the underworld to earth  and Hermes and gleaming-eyed Athena blazed the way!' </p>

<p>With that he turned and back he went to the House of Death  but 1 held fast in place, hoping others might still come,  shades of famous heroes, men who died in the old days  and ghosts of an even older age 1 longed to see,  Theseus and Pirithous, the gods' own radiant sons.  But before 1 could, the dead came surging round me,  hordes of them, thousands raising unearthly cries,  and blanching terror gripped me &mdash; panicked now  that Queen Persephone might send up from Death  some monstrous head, some Gorgon's staring face!  1 rushed back to my ship, commanded all hands  to take to the decks and cast off cables quickly.  They swung aboard at once, they sat to the oars in ranks  and a strong tide of the Ocean River swept her on downstream,  sped by our rowing first, then by a fresh fair wind.&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>Book XII </p>

<p></p>

<p>The Cattle of  the Sun </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Now when our ship had left the Ocean River rolling in her wake  and launched out into open sea with its long swells to reach  the island of Aeaea &mdash; east where the Dawn forever young  has home and dancing-rings and the Sun his risings &mdash;  heading in we beached our craft on the sands,  the crews swung out on the low sloping shore  and there we fell asleep, awaiting Dawn's first light. </p>

<p>As soon as Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone again  1 dispatched some men to Circe's halls to bring  the dead Elpenor's body. We cut logs in haste  and out on the island's sharpest jutting headland  held his funeral rites in sorrow, streaming tears.  Once we'd burned the dead man and the dead man's armor,  heaping his grave-mound, hauling a stone that coped it well. </p>

<p></p>

<p>we planted his balanced oar aloft to crown his tomb. </p>

<p>And so we saw to his rites, each step in turn.  Nor did our coming back from Death escape Circe &mdash;  she hurried toward us, decked in rich regalia,  handmaids following close with trays of bread  and meats galore and glinting ruddy wine.  And the lustrous goddess, standing in our midst,  hailed us warmly: Ah my darling, reckless friends!  You who ventured down to the House of Death alive,  doomed to die twice over &mdash; others die just once.  Come, take some food and drink some wine,  rest here the livelong day  and then, tomorrow at daybreak, you must sail.  But 1 will set you a course and chart each seamark,  so neither on sea nor land will some new trap  ensnare you in trouble, make you suffer more.' </p>

<p>Her foresight won our fighting spirits over.  So all that day till the sun went down we sat  and feasted on sides of meat and heady wine,  and then when the sun had set and night came on  the men lay down to sleep by the ship's stern-cables.  But Circe, taking me by the hand, drew me away  from all my shipmates there and sat me down  and lying beside me probed me for details.  1 told her the whole story, start to finish,  then the queenly goddess laid my course:  'Your descent to the dead is over, true,  but listen closely to what 1 tell you now  and god himself will bring it back to mind.  First you will raise the island of the Sirens,  those creatures who spellbind any man alive,  whoever comes their way. Whoever draws too close,  off guard, and catches the Sirens' voices in the air &mdash;  no sailing home for him, no wife rising to meet him,  no happy children beaming up at their father's face.  The high, thrilling song of the Sirens will transfix him. </p>

<p></p>

<p>lolling there in their meadow, round them heaps of corpses,  rotting away, rags of skin shriveling on their bones ...  Race straight past that coast! Soften some beeswax  and stop your shipmates' ears so none can hear,  none of the crew, but if you are bent on hearing,  have them tie you hand and foot in the swift ship,  erect at the mast-block, lashed by ropes to the mast  so you can hear the Sirens' song to your heart's content.  But if you plead, commanding your men to set you free,  then they must lash you faster, rope on rope. </p>

<p>But once your crew has rowed you past the Sirens  a choice of routes is yours. 1 cannot advise you  which to take, or lead you through it all &mdash;  you must decide for yourself &mdash;  but 1 can tell you the ways of either course.  On one side beetling cliffs shoot up, and against them  pound the huge roaring breakers of blue-eyed Amphitrite &mdash;  the Clashing Rocks they're called by all the blissful gods.  Not even birds can escape them, no, not even the doves  that veer and fly ambrosia home to Father Zeus:  even of those the sheer Rocks always pick off one  and Father wings one more to keep the number up.  No ship of men has ever approached and slipped past &mdash;  always some disaster &mdash; big timbers and sailors' corpses  whirled away by the waves and lethal blasts of fire.  One ship alone, one deep-sea craft sailed clear,  the Arffo, sung by the world, when heading home  from Aeetes' shores. And 5Ae would have crashed  against those giant rocks and sunk at once if Hera,  for love of Jason, had not sped her through. </p>

<p>On the other side loom two enormous crags ...  One thrusts into the vaulting sky its jagged peak,  hooded round with a dark cloud that never leaves &mdash;  no clear bright air can ever bathe its crown,  not even in summer's heat or harvest-time.  No man on earth could scale it, mount its crest. </p>

<p></p>

<p>not even with twenty hands and twenty feet for cUmbing,  the rock's so smooth, like dressed and burnished stone.  And halfway up that cliff side stands a fog-bound cavern  gaping west toward Erebus, realm of death and darkness &mdash;  past it, great Odysseus, you should steer your ship.  No rugged young archer could hit that yawning cave  with a winged arrow shot from off the decks.  Scylla lurks inside it &mdash; the yelping horror,  yelping, no louder than any suckling pup,  but she's a grisly monster, 1 assure you.  No one could look on her with any joy,  not even a god who meets her face-to-face ...  She has twelve legs, all writhing, dangling down  and six long swaying necks, a hideous head on each,  each head barbed with a triple row of fangs, thickset,  packed tight &mdash; armed to the hilt with black death!  Holed up in the cavern's bowels from her waist down  she shoots out her heads, out of that terrifying pit,  angling right from her nest, wildly sweeping the reefs  for dolphins, dogfish or any bigger quarry she can drag  from the thousands Amphitrite spawns in groaning seas.  No mariners yet can boast they've raced their ship  past Scylla's lair without some mortal blow &mdash;  with each of her six heads she snatches up  a man from the dark-prowed craft and whisks him off. </p>

<p>The other crag is lower &mdash; you will see, Odysseus &mdash;  though both lie side-by-side, an arrow-shot apart.  Atop it a great fig-tree rises, shaggy with leaves;  beneath it awesome Chary bdis gulps the dark water down.  Three times a day she vomits it up, three times she gulps it down,  that terror! Don't be ^Aere when the whirlpool swallows down &mdash;  not even the earthquake god could save you from disaster.  No, hug Scylla's crag &mdash; sail on past her &mdash; ^top speed!  Better by far to lose six men and keep your ship  than lose your entire crew.' </p>

<p>'Yes, yes, </p>

<p>but tell me the truth now, goddess,' 1 protested. </p>

<p></p>

<p>'Deadly Charybdis &mdash; can't I possibly cut and run from her  and still fight Scylla off when Scylla strikes my men?' </p>

<p>'So stubborn!' the lovely goddess countered.  'Hell-bent yet again on battle and feats of arms?  Can't you bow to the deathless gods themselves?  Scylla's no mortal, she's an immortal devastation,  terrible, savage, wild, no fighting her, no defense &mdash;  just flee the creature, that's the only way.  Waste any time, arming for battle beside her rock,  1 fear she'll lunge out again with all of her six heads  and seize as many men. No, row for your lives,  invoke Brute Force, 1 tell you, Scylla's mother &mdash;  she spawned her to scourge mankind,  she cow stop the monster's next attack! </p>

<p>Then you will make the island of Thrinacia ...  where herds of the Sungod's cattle graze, and fat sheep  and seven herds of oxen, as many sheepflocks, rich and woolly,  fifty head in each. No breeding swells their number,  nor do they ever die. And goddesses herd them on,  nymphs with glinting hair, Phaethousa, Lampetie,  born to the Sungod Helios by radiant Neaera.  Their queenly mother bred and reared them both,  then settled them on the island of Thrinacia &mdash;  their homeland seas away &mdash;  to guard their father's sheep and longhorn cattle.  Leave the beasts unharmed, your mind set on home,  and you a77may still reach Ithaca &mdash; bent with hardship,  true &mdash; but harm them in any way, and 1 can see it now:  your ship destroyed, your men destroyed as well!  And even if f/f7f/ escape, you'll come home late,  all shipmates lost, and come a broken man.' </p>

<p>At those words Dawn rose on her golden throne  and lustrous Circe made her way back up the island.  1 went straight to my ship, commanding all hands  to take to the decks and cast off cables quickly. </p>

<p></p>

<p>They swung aboard at once, they sat to the oars in ranks </p>

<p>and in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke. </p>

<p>And Circe the nymph with glossy braids, the awesome one </p>

<p>who speaks with human voice, sent us a hardy shipmate, </p>

<p>yes, a fresh following wind ruffling up in our wake, </p>

<p>bellying out our sail to drive our blue prow on as we, </p>

<p>securing the running gear from stem to stern, sat back </p>

<p>while the wind and helmsman kept her true on course. </p>

<p>At last, and sore at heart, 1 told my shipmates, </p>

<p>'Friends ... it's wrong for only one or two </p>

<p>to know the revelations that lovely Circe </p>

<p>made to me alone. I'll tell you all, </p>

<p>so we can die with our eyes wide open now </p>

<p>or escape our fate and certain death together. </p>

<p>First, she warns, we must steer clear of the Sirens, </p>

<p>their enchanting song, their meadow starred with flowers. </p>

<p>1 alone was to hear their voices, so she said, </p>

<p>but you must bind me with tight chafing ropes </p>

<p>so 1 cannot move a muscle, bound to the spot, </p>

<p>erect at the mast-block, lashed by ropes to the mast. </p>

<p>And if 1 plead, commanding you to set me free, </p>

<p>then lash me faster, rope on pressing rope.' </p>

<p>So 1 informed my shipmates point by point,  all the while our trim ship was speeding toward  the Sirens' island, driven on by the brisk wind.  But then &mdash; ^the wind fell in an instant,  all glazed to a dead calm ...  a mysterious power hushed the heaving swells.  The oarsmen leapt to their feet, struck the sail,  stowed it deep in the hold and sat to the oarlocks,  thrashing with polished oars, frothing the water white.  Now with a sharp sword 1 sliced an ample wheel of beeswax  down into pieces, kneaded them in my two strong hands  and the wax soon grew soft, worked by my strength  and Helios' burning rays, the sun at high noon,  and 1 stopped the ears of my comrades one by one.  They bound me hand and foot in the tight ship &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>erect at the mast-block, lashed by ropes to the mast &mdash;  and rowed and churned the whitecaps stroke on stroke.  We were just offshore as far as a man's shout can carry,  scudding close, when the Sirens sensed at once a ship  was racing past and burst into their high, thrilling song:  Come closer, famous Odysseus &mdash; ^Achaea's pride and glory &mdash;  moor your ship on our coast so you can hear our song!  Never has any sailor passed our shores in his black craft  until he has heard the honeyed voices pouring from our lips,  and once he hears to his heart's content sails on, a wiser man.  We know all the pains that Achaeans and Trojans once endured  on the spreading plain of Troy when the gods willed it so &mdash;  all that comes to pass on the fertile earth, we know it all!' </p>

<p>So they sent their ravishing voices out across the air  and the heart inside me throbbed to listen longer.  1 signaled the crew with frowns to set me free &mdash;  they flung themselves at the oars and rowed on harder,  Perimedes and Eurylochus springing up at once  to bind me faster with rope on chafing rope.  But once we'd left the Sirens fading in our wake,  once we could hear their song no more, their urgent call &mdash;  my steadfast crew was quick to remove the wax I'd used  to seal their ears and loosed the bonds that lashed me. </p>

<p>We'd scarcely put that island astern when suddenly  1 saw smoke and heavy breakers, heard their booming thunder.  The men were terrified &mdash; oarblades flew from their grip,  clattering down to splash in the vessel's wash.  She lay there, dead in the water ...  no hands to tug the blades that drove her on.  But 1 strode down the decks to rouse my crewmen,  halting beside each one with a bracing, winning word:  'Friends, we're hardly strangers at meeting danger &mdash;  and this danger is no worse than what we faced  when Cyclops penned us up in his vaulted cave  with crushing force! But even from there my courage,  my presence of mind and tactics saved us all. </p>

<p></p>

<p>and we will live to remember this someday,  1 have no doubt. Up now, follow my orders,  all of us work as one! You men at the thwarts &mdash;  lay on with your oars and strike the heaving swells,  trusting that Zeus will pull us through these straits alive.  You, helmsman, here's your order &mdash; burn it in your mind &mdash;  the steering-oar of our rolling ship is in your hands.  Keep her clear of that smoke and surging breakers,  head for those crags or she'll catch you off guard,  she'll yaw over there &mdash; you'll plunge us all in ruin!' </p>

<p>So 1 shouted. They snapped to each command.  No mention of Scylla &mdash; how to fight that nightmare? &mdash;  for fear the men would panic, desert their oars  and huddle down and stow themselves away.  But now 1 cleared my mind of Circe's orders &mdash;  cramping my style, urging me not to arm at all.  1 donned my heroic armor, seized long spears  in both my hands and marched out on the half-deck,  forward, hoping from there to catch the first glimpse  of Scylla, ghoul of the cliffs, swooping to kill my men.  But nowhere could 1 make her out &mdash; and my eyes ached,  scanning that mist-bound rock face top to bottom. </p>

<p>Now wailing in fear, we rowed on up those straits,  Scylla to starboard, dreaded Charybdis off to port,  her horrible whirlpool gulping the sea-surge down, down  but when she spewed it up &mdash; like a cauldron over a raging fire &mdash;  all her churning depths would seethe and heave &mdash; exploding spray  showering down to splatter&quot; the peaks of both crags at once!  But when she swallowed the sea-surge down her gaping maw  the whole abyss lay bare and the rocks around her roared,  terrible, deafening &mdash; </p>

<p>bedrock showed down deep, boiling </p>

<p>black with sand &mdash; </p>

<p>and ashen terror gripped the men.  But now, fearing death, all eyes fixed on Charybdis &mdash;  now Scylla snatched six men from our hollow ship. </p>

<p></p>

<p>the toughest, strongest hands I had, and glancing  backward over the decks, searching for my crew  I could see their hands and feet already hoisted,  flailing, high, higher, over my head, look &mdash;  wailing down at me, comrades riven in agony,  shrieking out my name for one last time!  Just as an angler poised on a jutting rock  flings his treacherous bait in the offshore swell,  whips his long rod &mdash; hook sheathed in an oxhorn lure &mdash;  and whisks up little fish he flips on the beach-break,  writhing, gasping out their lives ... so now they writhed,  gasping as Scylla swung them up her cliff, and there  at her cavern's mouth she bolted them down raw &mdash;  screaming out, flinging their arms toward me,  lost in that mortal struggle ...  Of all the pitiful things I've had to witness,  suffering, searching out the pathways of the sea,  this wrenched my heart the most. </p>

<p>But now, at last,  putting the Rocks, Scylla and dread Charybdis far astern,  we quickly reached the good green island of the Sun  where Helios, lord Hyperion, keeps his fine cattle,  broad in the brow, and flocks of purebred sheep.  Still aboard my black ship in the open sea  1 could hear the lowing cattle driven home,  the bleating sheep. And 1 was struck once more  by the words of the blind Theban prophet, Tiresias,  and Aeaean Circe too: time and again they told me  to shun this island of the Sun, the joy of man.  So 1 warned my shipmates gravely, sick at heart,  'Listen to me, my comrades, brothers in hardship,  let me tell you the dire prophecies of Tiresias  and Aeaean Circe too: time and again they told me  to shun this island of the Sun, the joy of man.  Here, they warned, the worst disaster awaits us.  Row straight past these shores &mdash; race our black ship on!' </p>

<p></p>

<p>So I said, and the warnings broke their hearts.  But Eurylochus waded in at once &mdash; with mutiny on his mind:  'You're a hard man, Odysseus. Your fighting spirit's  stronger than ours, your stamina never fails.  You must be made of iron head to foot. Look,  your crew's half -dead with labor, starved for sleep,  and you iorhid us to set foot on land, this island here,  washed by the waves, where we might catch a decent meal again.  Drained as we are, night falling fast, you'd have us desert  this haven and blunder off, into the mist-bound seas?  Out of the night come winds that shatter vessels &mdash;  how can a man escape his headlong death  if suddenly, out of nowhere, a cyclone hits,  bred by the South or stormy West Wind? They 're the gales  that tear a ship to splinters &mdash; the gods, our masters,  willing or not, it seems. No, let's give way  to the dark night, set out our supper here.  Sit tight by our swift ship and then at daybreak  board and launch her, make for open sea!' </p>

<p>So Eurylochus urged, and shipmates cheered.  Then 1 knew some power was brewing trouble for us,  so 1 let fly with an anxious plea: 'Eurylochus,  I'm one against all &mdash; the upper hand is yours.  But swear me a binding oath, all here, that if  we come on a herd of cattle or fine flock of sheep,  not one man among us &mdash; blind in his reckless ways &mdash;  will slaughter an ox or ram. Just eat in peace,  content with the food immortal Circe gave us.' </p>

<p>They quickly swore the oath that 1 required  and once they had vowed they 'd never harm the herds,  they moored our sturdy ship in the deep narrow harbor,  close to a fresh spring, and all hands disembarked  and adeptly set about the evening meal.  Once they 'd put aside desire for food and drink,  they recalled our dear companions, wept for the men  that Scylla plucked from the hollow ship and ate alive,  and a welcome sleep came on them in their tears. </p>

<p></p>

<p>But then, </p>

<p>at the night's third watch, the stars just wheeling down,  Zeus who marshals the stormclouds loosed a ripping wind,  a howling, demonic gale, shrouding over in thunderheads  the earth and sea at once &mdash; and night swept down from the sky.  When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more  we hauled our craft ashore, securing her in a vaulted cave  where nymphs have lovely dancing-rings and hold their sessions.  There 1 called a muster, warning my shipmates yet again,  'Friends, we've food and drink aplenty aboard the ship &mdash;  keep hands off all these herds or we will pay the price!  The cattle, the sleek flocks, belong to an awesome master,  Helios, god of the sun who sees all, hears all things.' </p>

<p>So 1 warned, and my headstrong men complied.  But for one whole month the South Wind blew nonstop,  no other wind came up, none but the South, Southeast.  As long as our food and ruddy wine held out, the crew,  eager to save their lives, kept hands off the herds.  But then, when supplies aboard had all run dry,  when the men turned to hunting, forced to range  for quarry with twisted hooks: for fish, birds,  anything they could lay their hands on &mdash;  hunger racked their bellies &mdash; 1 struck inland,  up the island, there to pray to the gods.  If only one might show me some way home!  Crossing into the heartland, clear of the crew,  1 rinsed my hands in a sheltered spot, a windbreak,  but soon as I'd prayed to all the gods who rule Olympus,  down on my eyes they poured a sweet, sound sleep ...  as Eury lochus opened up his fatal plan to friends:  'Listen to me, my comrades, brothers in hardship.  All ways of dying are hateful to us poor mortals,  true, but to die of hunger, starve to death &mdash;  that's the worst of all. So up with you now,  let's drive off the pick of Helios' sleek herds,  slaughter them to the gods who rule the skies up there.  If we ever make it home to Ithaca, native ground. </p>

<p></p>

<p>erect at once a glorious temple to the Sungod,  line the walls with hoards of dazzling gifts!  But if the Sun, inflamed for his longhorn cattle,  means to wreck our ship and the other gods pitch in &mdash;  I'd rather die at sea, with one deep gulp of death,  than die by inches on this desolate island here!' </p>

<p>So he urged, and shipmates cheered again.  At once they drove off the Sungod s finest cattle &mdash;  close at hand, not far from the blue-prowed ship they grazed,  those splendid beasts with their broad brows and curving horns.  Surrounding them in a ring, they lifted prayers to the gods,  plucking fresh green leaves from a tall oak for the rite,  since white strewing-barley was long gone in the ship.  Once they'd prayed, slaughtered and skinned the cattle,  they cut the thighbones out, they wrapped them round in fat,  a double fold sliced clean and topped with strips of flesh.  And since they had no wine to anoint the glowing victims,  they made libations with water, broiling all the innards,  and once they'd burned the bones and tasted the organs &mdash;  hacked the rest into pieces, piercing them with spits. </p>

<p>That moment soothing slumber fell from my eyes  and down 1 went to our ship at the water's edge  but on my way, nearing the long beaked craft,  the smoky savor of roasts came floating up around me ...  1 groaned in anguish, crying out to the deathless gods:  'Father Zeus! the rest of you blissful gods who never die &mdash;  you with your fatal sleep, you lulled me into disaster.  Left on their own, look what a monstrous thing  my crew concocted!' </p>

<p>Quick as a flash  with her flaring robes Lampetie sped the news  to the Sun on high that we had killed his herds,  and Helios burst out in rage to all the immortals:  'Father Zeus! the rest of you blissful gods who never die &mdash;  punish them all, that crew of Laertes' son Odysseus &mdash;  what an outrage! They, they killed my cattle. </p>

<p></p>

<p>the great joy of my heart ... day in, day out, </p>

<p>when I climbed the starry skies and when I wheeled </p>

<p>back down from the heights to touch the earth once more. </p>

<p>Unless they pay me back in blood for the butchery of my herds, </p>

<p>down 1 go to the House of Death and blaze among the dead!' </p>

<p>But Zeus who marshals the thunderheads insisted.  Sun, you keep on shining among the deathless gods  and mortal men across the good green earth.  And as for the guilty ones, why, soon enough  on the wine-dark sea I'll hit their racing ship  with a white-hot bolt, I'll tear it into splinters.' </p>

<p>&mdash; Or so 1 heard from the lovely nymph Calypso,  who heard it herself, she said, from Hermes, god of guides. </p>

<p>As soon as 1 reached our ship at the water's edge  1 took the men to task, upbraiding each in turn,  but how to set things right? We couldn't find a way.  The cattle were dead already ...  and the gods soon showed us all some fateful signs &mdash;  the hides began to crawl, the meat, both raw and roasted,  bellowed out on the spits, and we heard a noise  like the moan of lowing oxen. </p>

<p>Yet six more days  my eager companions feasted on the cattle of the Sun,  the pick of the herds they'd driven off, but then,  when Cronian Zeus brought on the seventh day,  the wind in its ceaseless raging dropped at last,  and stepping the mast at once, hoisting the white sail  we boarded ship and launched her, made for open sea. </p>

<p>But once we'd left that island in our wake &mdash;  no land at all in sight, nothing but sea and sky &mdash;  then Zeus the son of Cronus mounted a thunderhead  above our hollow ship and the deep went black beneath it.  Nor did the craft scud on much longer. All of a sudden  killer-squalls attacked us, screaming out of the west. </p>

<p></p>

<p>a murderous blast shearing the two forestays off  so the mast toppled backward, its running tackle spilling  into the bilge. The mast itself went crashing into the stern,  it struck the helmsman's head and crushed his skull to pulp  and down from his deck the man flipped like a diver &mdash;  his hardy life spirit left his bones behind.  Then, then in the same breath Zeus hit the craft  with a lightning-bolt and thunder. Round she spun,  reeling under the impact, filled with reeking brimstone,  shipmates pitching out of her, bobbing round like seahawks  swept along by the whitecaps past the trim black hull &mdash;  and the god cut short their journey home forever. </p>

<p>But 1 went lurching along our battered hulk  till the sea-surge ripped the plankings from the keel  and the waves swirled it away, stripped bare, and snapped  the mast from the decks &mdash; but a backstay made of buU's-hide  still held fast, and with this 1 lashed the mast and keel  together, made them one, riding my makeshift raft  as the wretched galewinds bore me on and on. </p>

<p>At last the West Wind quit its wild rage  but the South came on at once to hound me even more,  making me double back my route toward cruel Charybdis.  All night long 1 was rushed back, and then at break of day  1 reached the crag of Scylla and dire Charybdis' vortex  right when the dreadful whirlpool gulped the salt sea down.  But heaving myself aloft to clutch at the fig-tree's height,  like a bat 1 clung to its trunk for dear life &mdash; not a chance  for a good firm foothold there, no clambering up it either,  the roots too far to reach, the boughs too high overhead,  huge swaying branches that overshadowed Charybdis.  But 1 held on, dead set ... waiting for her  to vomit my mast and keel back up again &mdash;  Oh how 1 ached for both! and back they came,  late but at last, at just the hour a judge at court,  who's settled the countless suits of brash young claimants,  rises, the day 's work done, and turns home for supper &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>that's when the timbers reared back up from Charybdis.  I let go &mdash; I plunged with my hands and feet flailing,  crashing into the waves beside those great beams  and scrambling aboard them fast  1 rowed hard with my hands right through the straits ...  And the father of men and gods did not let Scylla see me,  else I'd have died on the spot &mdash; no escape from death. </p>

<p>1 drifted along nine days. On the tenth, at night,  the gods cast me up on Ogygia, Calypso's island,  home of the dangerous nymph with glossy braids  who speaks with human voice, and she took me in,  she loved me ... Why cover the same ground again?  Just yesterday, here at hall, 1 told you all the rest,  you and your gracious wife. It goes against my grain  to repeat a tale told once, and told so clearly.&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>Book XIII </p>

<p></p>

<p>Ithaca at Last </p>

<p></p>

<p>His tale was over now. The Phaeacians all fell silent, hushed,  his story holding them spellbound down the shadowed halls  until Alcinous found the poise to say, &quot;Odysseus,  now that you have come to my bronze-floored house,  my vaulted roofs, 1 know you won't be driven  off your course, nothing can hold you back &mdash;  however much you've suffered, you'll sail home.  Here, friends, here's a command for one and all,  you who frequent my palace day and night and drink  the shining wine of kings and enjoy the harper's songs.  The robes and hammered gold and a haul of other gifts  you lords of our island council brought our guest &mdash;  all lie packed in his polished sea-chest now. Come,  each of us add a sumptuous tripod, add a cauldron! </p>

<p></p>

<p>Then recover our costs with levies on the people:  it's hard to afford such bounty man by man. &quot; </p>

<p>The king's instructions met with warm applause  and home they went to sleep, each in his own house.  When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more  they hurried down to the ship with handsome bronze gifts,  and striding along the decks, the ardent King Alcinous  stowed them under the benches, shipshape, so nothing  could foul the crewmen tugging at their oars.  Then back the party went to Alcinous' house  and shared a royal feast. </p>

<p>The majestic king  slaughtered an ox for them to Cronus' mighty son,  Zeus of the thundercloud, whose power rules the world.  They burned the thighs and fell to the lordly banquet,  reveling there, while in their midst the inspired bard  struck up a song, Demodocus, prized by all the people.  True, but time and again Odysseus turned his face  toward the radiant sun, anxious for it to set,  yearning now to be gone and home once more ...  As a man aches for his evening meal when all day long  his brace of wine-dark oxen have dragged the bolted plowshare  down a fallow field &mdash; how welcome the setting sun to him,  the going home to supper, yes, though his knees buckle,  struggling home at last. So welcome now to Odysseus  the setting light of day, and he lost no time  as he pressed Phaeacia's men who love their oars,  addressing his host, Alcinous, first and foremost:  &quot;Alcinous, majesty, shining among your island people,  make your libations, launch me safely on my way &mdash;  to one and all, farewell!  All is now made good, my heart's desire,  your convoy home, your precious, loving gifts,  and may the gods of Olympus bless them for me!  May 1 find an unswerving wife when 1 reach home,  and loved ones hale, unharmed! And you, my friends </p>

<p></p>

<p>remaining here in your kingdom now, may you delight  in your loyal wives and children! May the gods  rain down all kinds of fortune on your lives,  misfortune never harbor in your homeland!&quot; </p>

<p>All burst into applause, urging passage home  for their parting guest, his farewell rang so true.  Hallowed King Alcinous briskly called his herald:  &quot;Come, Pontonous! Mix the wine in the bowl,  pour rounds to all our banqueters in the house,  so we, with a prayer to mighty Zeus the Father,  can sail our new friend home to native land.&quot; </p>

<p>Pontonous mixed the heady, honeyed wine  and hovering closely, poured full rounds for all.  And from where they sat they tipped libations out  to the happy gods who rule the vaulting skies.  Then King Odysseus rose up from his seat  and placing his two-eared cup in Arete 's hands,  addressed the queen with parting wishes on the wing:  &quot;Your health, my queen, through all your days to come &mdash;  until old age and death, that visit all mankind,  pay you a visit too. Now 1 am on my way,  but you, may you take joy in this house of yours,  in your children, your people, in Alcinous the king!&quot; </p>

<p>With that the great Odysseus strode across the threshold.  And King Alcinous sent the herald off with the guest  to lead him down to the swift ship and foaming surf.  And Arete sent her serving-women, one to carry  a sea-cloak, washed and fresh, a shirt as well,  another assigned to bear the sturdy chest  and a third to take the bread and ruddy wine. </p>

<p>When they reached the ship at the water's edge  the royal escorts took charge of the gifts at once  and stores of food and wine, stowed them deep in the holds,  and then for their guest they spread out rug and sheets </p>

<p></p>

<p>on the half -deck, clear astern on the ship's hull </p>

<p>so he might sleep there soundly, undisturbed. </p>

<p>And last, Odysseus climbed aboard himself </p>

<p>and down he lay, all quiet, </p>

<p>as crewmen sat to the oarlocks, each in line. </p>

<p>They slipped the cable free of the drilled stone post </p>

<p>and soon as they swung back and the blades tossed up the spray </p>

<p>an irresistible sleep fell deeply on his eyes, the sweetest, </p>

<p>soundest oblivion, still as the sleep of death itself ... </p>

<p>And the ship like a four-horse team careering down the plain, </p>

<p>all breaking as one with the whiplash cracking smartly, </p>

<p>leaping with hoofs high to run the course in no time &mdash; </p>

<p>so the stern hove high and plunged with the seething rollers </p>

<p>crashing dark in her wake as on she surged unwavering, </p>

<p>never flagging, no, not even a darting hawk, </p>

<p>the quickest thing on wings, could keep her pace </p>

<p>as on she ran, cutting the swells at top speed, </p>

<p>bearing a man equipped with the gods' own wisdom, </p>

<p>one who had suffered twenty years of torment, sick at heart, </p>

<p>cleaving his way through wars of men and pounding waves at sea </p>

<p>but now he slept in peace, the memory of his struggles </p>

<p>laid to rest. </p>

<p>And then, that hour the star rose up,  the clearest, brightest star, that always heralds  the newborn light of day, the deep-sea-going ship  made landfall on the island ... Ithaca, at last. </p>

<p>There on the coast a haven lies, named for Phorcys,  the old god of the deep &mdash; with two jutting headlands,  sheared off at the seaward side but shelving toward the bay,  that break the great waves whipped by the gales outside  so within the harbor ships can ride unmoored  whenever they come in mooring range of shore.  At the harbor's head a branching olive stands  with a welcome cave nearby it, dank with sea-mist,  sacred to nymphs of the springs we call the Naiads.  There are mixing-bowls inside and double-handled jars,  crafted of stone, and bees store up their honey in the hollows. </p>

<p></p>

<p>There are long stone looms as well, where the nymphs weave out </p>

<p>their webs from clouds of sea-blue wool &mdash; a marvelous sight &mdash; </p>

<p>and a wellspring flows forever. The cave has two ways in, </p>

<p>one facing the North Wind, a pathway down for mortals; </p>

<p>the other, facing the South, belongs to the gods, </p>

<p>no man may go that way ... </p>

<p>it is the path for all the deathless powers. </p>

<p>Here at this bay the Phaeacian crew put in &mdash;  they 'd known it long before &mdash; driving the ship so hard  she ran up onto the beach for a good half her length,  such way the oarsmen's brawny arms had made.  Up from the benches, swinging down to land,  first they lifted Odysseus off the decks &mdash;  linen and lustrous carpet too &mdash; and laid him  down on the sand asleep, still dead to the world,  then hoisted out the treasures proud Phaeacians,  urged by open-hearted Pallas, had lavished on him,  setting out for home. They heaped them all  by the olive's trunk, in a neat pile, clear  of the road for fear some passerby might spot  and steal Odysseus' hoard before he could awaken.  Then pushing off, they pulled for home themselves. </p>

<p>But now Poseidon, god of the earthquake, never once  forgetting the first threats he leveled at the hero,  probed almighty Zeus to learn his plans in full:  &quot;Zeus, Father, 1 will lose all my honor now  among the immortals, now there are mortal men  who show me no respect &mdash; Phaeacians, too,  born of my own loins! 1 said myself  that Odysseus would suffer long and hard  before he made it home, but 1 never dreamed  of blocking his return, not absolutely at least,  once youhadi pledged your word and bowed your head.  But now they've swept him across the sea in their swift ship,  they've set him down in Ithaca, sound asleep, and loaded the man  with boundless gifts &mdash; bronze and hoards of gold and robes &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>aye, more plunder than he could ever have won from Troy  if Odysseus had returned intact with his fair share!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Incredible, &quot; Zeus who marshals the thunderheads replied.  &quot;Earth-shaker, you with your massive power, why moaning so?  The gods don't disrespect you. What a stir there'd be  if they flung abuse at the oldest, noblest of them all.  Those mortals? If any man, so lost in his strength  and prowess, pays you no respect&mdash; just pay him back.  The power is always yours.  Do what you like. Whatever warms your heart.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;King of the dark cloud,&quot; the earthquake god agreed,  &quot;I'd like to avenge myself at once, as you advise,  but I've always feared your wrath and shied away.  But now I'll crush that fine Phaeacian cutter  out on the misty sea, now on her homeward run  from the latest convoy. They will learn at last  to cease and desist from escorting every man alive &mdash;  I'll pile a huge mountain round about their port!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Wait, dear brother,&quot; Zeus who collects the clouds  had second thoughts. &quot;Here's what seems best to me.  As the people all lean down from the city heights  to watch her speeding home, strike her into a rock  that looks like a racing vessel, just offshore &mdash;  amaze all men with a marvel for the ages.  Then pile your huge mountain round about their port.&quot; </p>

<p>Hearing ^Aa^ from Zeus, the god of the earthquake  sped to Scheria now, the Phaeacians' island home,  and waited there till the ship came sweeping in,  scudding lightly along &mdash; and surging close abreast,  the earthquake god with one flat stroke of his hand  struck her to stone, rooted her to the ocean floor  and made for open sea. </p>

<p>The Phaeacians, aghast,  those lords of the long oars, the master mariners </p>

<p></p>

<p>traded startled glances, sudden outcries:  &quot;Look &mdash; who's pinned our swift ship to the sea?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Just racing for home!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Just hove into plain view!&quot; </p>

<p>They might well wonder, blind to what had happened,  till Alcinous rose and made things all too clear:  &quot;Oh no &mdash; my father's prophecy years ago ...  it all comes home to me with a vengeance now!  He'd say Poseidon was vexed with us because  we escorted all mankind and never came to grief.  He said that one day, as a well-built ship of ours  sailed home on the misty sea from such a convoy,  the god would crush it, yes,  and pile a huge mountain round about our port.  So the old king foretold. Now, look, it all comes true!  Hurry, friends, do as 1 say, let us all comply:  stop our convoys home for every castaway  chancing on our city! As for Poseidon,  sacrifice twelve bulls to the god at once &mdash;  the pick of the herds. Perhaps he'll pity us,  pile no looming mountain ridge around our port.&quot; </p>

<p>The people, terrified, prepared the bulls at once.  So all of Phaeacia's island lords and captains,  milling round the altar, lifted prayers  to Poseidon, master of the sea ... </p>

<p>That very moment  great Odysseus woke from sleep on native ground at last &mdash;  he'd been away for years &mdash; but failed to know the land,  for the goddess Pallas Athena, Zeus's daughter,  showered mist over all, so under cover  she might change his appearance head to foot  as she told him every peril he'd meet at home &mdash;  keep him from being known by wife, townsmen, friends,  till the suitors paid the price for all their outrage.  And so to the king himself all Ithaca looked strange ... </p>

<p></p>

<p>the winding beaten paths, the coves where ships can ride, </p>

<p>the steep rock face of the cliffs and the tall leafy trees. </p>

<p>He sprang to his feet and, scanning his own native country, </p>

<p>groaned, slapped his thighs with his flat palms </p>

<p>and Odysseus cried in anguish: </p>

<p>&quot;Man of misery, whose land have 1 lit on now? </p>

<p>What arfthey here &mdash; violent, savage, lawless? </p>

<p>or friendly to strangers, god-fearing men? </p>

<p>Where can 1 take this heap of treasure now </p>

<p>and where in the world do 1 wander off myself? </p>

<p>If only the trove had stayed among the Phaeacians there </p>

<p>and 1 had made my way to some other mighty king </p>

<p>who would have hosted me well and sent me home! </p>

<p>But now 1 don't know where to stow all this, </p>

<p>and 1 can't leave it here, inviting any bandit </p>

<p>to rob me blind. </p>

<p>So damn those lords and captains,  those Phaeacians! Not entirely honest or upright, were they?  Sweeping me off to this, this no-man's-land, and they,  they swore they'd sail me home to sunny Ithaca &mdash; ^well,  they never kept their word. Zeus of the Suppliants  pay them back &mdash; he keeps an eye on the world of men  and punishes all transgressors! </p>

<p>Come, quickly, </p>

<p>I'll inspect my treasure and count it up myself.  Did they make off with anything in their ship?&quot; </p>

<p>With that he counted up the gorgeous tripods,  cauldrons, bars of gold and the lovely woven robes.  Not a stitch was missing from the lot. But still  he wept for his native country, trailing down the shore  where the wash of sea on shingle ebbs and flows,  his homesick heart in turmoil.  But now Athena appeared and came toward him.  She looked like a young man ... a shepherd boy  yet elegant too, with all the gifts that grace the sons of kings,  with a well-cut cloak falling in folds across her shoulders,  sandals under her shining feet, a hunting spear in hand. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Odysseus, overjoyed at the sight, went up to meet her, </p>

<p>joining her now with salutations on the wing: </p>

<p>&quot;Greetings, friend! Since you are the first </p>

<p>I've come on in this harbor, treat me kindly &mdash; </p>

<p>no cruelty, please. Save these treasures, </p>

<p>save me too. 1 pray to you like a god, </p>

<p>1 fall before your knees and ask your mercy! </p>

<p>And tell me this for a fact &mdash; 1 need to know &mdash; </p>

<p>where on earth am I? what land? who lives here? </p>

<p>Is it one of the sunny islands or some jutting shore </p>

<p>of the good green mainland slanting down to sea?&quot; </p>

<p>Athena answered, her eyes brightening now,  &quot;You must be a fool, stranger, or come from nowhere,  if you really have to ask what land this is.  Trust me, it's not so nameless after all.  It's known the world around,  to all who live to the east and rising sun  and to all who face the western mists and darkness.  It's a rugged land, too cramped for driving horses,  but though it's far from broad, it's hardly poor.  There's plenty of grain for bread, grapes for wine,  the rains never fail and the dewf all's healthy.  Good country for goats, good for cattle too &mdash;  there's stand on stand of timber  and water runs in streambeds through the year. </p>

<p>So, </p>

<p>stranger, the name of Ithaca's reached as far as Troy,  and Troy, they say, is a long hard sail from Greece.&quot; </p>

<p>Ithaca... Heart racing, Odysseus that great exile  filled with joy to hear Athena, daughter of storming Zeus,  pronounce that name. He stood on native ground at last  and he replied with a winging word to Pallas,  not with a word of truth &mdash; he choked it back,  always invoking the cunning in his heart:  &quot;Ithaca ... yes, I seem to have heard of Ithaca,  even on Crete's broad island far across the sea. </p>

<p></p>

<p>and now I've reached it myself, with all this loot, </p>

<p>but 1 left behind an equal measure for my children. </p>

<p>I'm a fugitive now, you see. 1 killed Idomeneus' son, </p>

<p>Orsilochus, lightning on his legs, a man who beat </p>

<p>all runners alive on that long island &mdash; what a racer! </p>

<p>He tried to rob me of all the spoil I'd won at Troy, </p>

<p>the plunder 1 went to hell and back to capture, true, </p>

<p>cleaving my way through wars of men and waves at sea &mdash; </p>

<p>and just because 1 refused to please his father, </p>

<p>serve under him at Troy. 1 led my own command. </p>

<p>So now with a friend 1 lay in wait by the road, </p>

<p>1 killed him just loping in from the fields &mdash; </p>

<p>with one quick stroke of my bronze spear </p>

<p>in the dead of night, the heavens pitch-black ... </p>

<p>no one could see us, spot me tearing out his life </p>

<p>with a weapon honed for action. Once I'd cut him down </p>

<p>1 made for a ship and begged the Phoenician crew for mercy, </p>

<p>paying those decent hands a hearty share of plunder &mdash; </p>

<p>asked them to take me on and land me down in Pylos, </p>

<p>there or lovely Elis, where Epeans rule in power. </p>

<p>But a heavy galewind blew them way off course, </p>

<p>much against their will &mdash; </p>

<p>they'd no desire to cheat me. Driven afar, </p>

<p>we reached this island here at the midnight hour, </p>

<p>rowing for dear life, we made it into your harbor &mdash; </p>

<p>not a thought of supper, much as we all craved food, </p>

<p>we dropped from the decks and lay down, just like that! </p>

<p>A welcome sleep came over my weary bones at once, </p>

<p>while the crew hoisted up my loot from the holds </p>

<p>and set it down on the sand near where 1 slept. </p>

<p>They reembarked, now homeward bound for Sidon, </p>

<p>their own noble city, leaving me here behind, </p>

<p>homesick in my heart ...&quot; </p>

<p>As his story ended,  goddess Athena, gray eyes gleaming, broke into a smile  and stroked him with her hand, and now she appeared a woman  beautiful, tall and skilled at weaving lovely things.  Her words went flying straight toward Odysseus: </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Any man &mdash; any god who met you &mdash; would have to be  some champion lying cheat to get past you  for all-round craft and guile! You terrible man,  foxy, ingenious, never tired of twists and tricks &mdash;  so, not even here, on native soil, would you give up  those wily tales that warm the cockles of your heart!  Come, enough of this now. We're both old hands  at the arts of intrigue. Here among mortal men  you're far the best at tactics, spinning yarns,  and 1 am famous among the gods for wisdom,  cunning wiles, too. </p>

<p>Ah, but you never recognized me, did you? </p>

<p>Pallas Athena, daughter of Zeus &mdash; who always </p>

<p>stands beside you, shields you in every exploit: </p>

<p>thanks to me the Phaeacians all embraced you warmly. </p>

<p>And now 1 am here once more, to weave a scheme with you </p>

<p>and to hide the treasure-trove Phaeacia's nobles </p>

<p>lavished on you then &mdash; 1 willed it, planned it so </p>

<p>when you set out for home &mdash; and to tell you all </p>

<p>the trials you must suffer in your palace ... </p>

<p>Endure them all. You must. You have no choice. </p>

<p>And to no one &mdash; no man, no woman, not a soul &mdash; </p>

<p>reveal that you are the wanderer home at last. </p>

<p>No, in silence you must bear a world of pain, </p>

<p>subject yourself to the cruel abuse of men.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ah goddess,&quot; the cool tactician countered,  &quot;you're so hard for a mortal man to know on sight,  however shrewd he is &mdash; ^the shapes you take are endless!  But 1 do know this: you were kind to me in the war years,  so long as we men of Achaea soldiered on at Troy.  But once we'd sacked King Priam's craggy city,  boarded ship, and a god dispersed the fleet,  from then on, daughter of Zeus, 1 never saw you,  never glimpsed you striding along my decks  to ward off some disaster. No, 1 wandered on,  my heart forever torn to pieces inside my chest </p>

<p></p>

<p>till the gods released me from my miseries at last, </p>

<p>that day in the fertile kingdom of Phaeacia when </p>

<p>you cheered me with words, in person, led me to their city. </p>

<p>But now 1 beg you by your almighty Father's name ... </p>

<p>for 1 can't believe I've reached my sunny Ithaca, </p>

<p>1 must be roaming around one more exotic land &mdash; </p>

<p>you're mocking me, 1 know it, telling me tales </p>

<p>to make me lose my way. Tell me the truth now, </p>

<p>have 1 really reached the land 1 love?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Always the same, your wary turn of mind,&quot;  Athena exclaimed, her glances flashing warmly.  &quot;That's why 1 can't forsake you in your troubles &mdash;  you are so winning, so worldly-wise, so self-possessed!  Anyone else, come back from wandering long and hard,  would have hurried home at once, delighted to see  his children and his wife. Oh, but not you,  it's not your pleasure to probe for news of them &mdash;  you must put your wife to the proof yourself!  But she, she waits in your halls, as always,  her life an endless hardship ...  wasting away the nights, weeping away the days.  1 never had doubts myself, no, 1 knew down deep  that you would return at last, with all your shipmates lost.  But 1 could not bring myself to fight my Father's brother,  Poseidon, quaking with anger at you, still enraged  because you blinded the Cyclops, his dear son.  But come, let me show you Ithaca's setting,  I'll convince you. This haven &mdash; look around &mdash;  it's named for Phorcy s, the old god of the deep,  and here at the harbor's head the branching olive stands  with the welcome cave nearby it, dank with sea-mist,  sacred to nymphs of the springs we call the Naiads.  Here, under its arching vault, time and again  you'd offer the nymphs a generous sacrifice  to bring success! And the slopes above you, look.  Mount Neriton decked in forests!&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>At those words </p>

<p>the goddess scattered the mist and the country stood out clear </p>

<p>and the great man who had borne so much rejoiced at last, </p>

<p>thrilled to see his Ithaca &mdash; kissed the good green earth </p>

<p>and raised his hands to the nymphs and prayed at once, </p>

<p>&quot;Nymphs of the springs, Naiads, daughters of Zeus, </p>

<p>1 never dreamed 1 would see you yet again ... </p>

<p>Now rejoice in my loving prayers &mdash; and later, </p>

<p>just like the old days, 1 will give you gifts </p>

<p>if Athena, Zeus 's daughter. Queen of Armies </p>

<p>comes to my rescue, grants this fighter life </p>

<p>and brings my son to manhood!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Courage!&quot;&mdash;  goddess Athena answered, eyes afire &mdash;  &quot;Free your mind of all that anguish now.  Come, quick, let's bury your treasures here  in some recess of this haunted hallowed cave  where they 'll be safe and sound,  then we'll make plans so we can win the day.&quot; </p>

<p>With that </p>

<p>the goddess swept into the cavern's shadowed vault,  searching for hiding-places far inside its depths  while Odysseus hauled his treasures closer up,  the gold, durable bronze and finespun robes,  the Phaeacians' parting gifts.  Once he'd stowed them well away, the goddess,  Pallas Athena, daughter of storming Zeus,  sealed the mouth of the cavern with a stone. </p>

<p>Then down they sat by the sacred olive's trunk  to plot the death of the high and mighty suitors.  The bright-eyed goddess Athena led the way:  &quot;Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, old campaigner,  think how to lay your hands on all those brazen suitors,  lording it over your house now, three whole years,  courting your noble wife, offering gifts to win her.  But she, forever broken-hearted for your return,  builds up each man's hopes &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>dangling promises, dropping hints to each &mdash;  but all the while with something else in mind. &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;God help me!&quot; the man of intrigue broke out:  &quot;Clearly I might have died the same ignoble death  as Agamemnon, bled white in my own house too,  if you had never revealed this to me now,  goddess, blow-by-blow. </p>

<p>Come, weave us a scheme so 1 can pay them back! </p>

<p>You stand beside me, fire me with daring, fierce </p>

<p>as the day we ripped Troy 's glittering crown of towers down. </p>

<p>Stand by me &mdash; furious now as then, my bright-eyed one &mdash; </p>

<p>and 1 would fight three hundred men, great goddess, </p>

<p>with you to brace me, comrade-in-arms in battle!&quot; </p>

<p>Gray eyes ablaze, the goddess urged him on:  &quot;Surely I'll stand beside you, not forget you,  not when the day arrives for us to do our work.  Those men who court your wife and waste your goods?  1 have a feeling some will splatter your ample floors  with all their blood and brains. Up now, quickly.  First 1 will transform you &mdash; no one must know you.  1 will shrivel the supple skin on your lithe limbs,  strip the russet curls from your head and deck you out  in rags you'd hate to see some other mortal wear;  I'll dim the fire in your eyes, so shining once &mdash;  until you seem appalling to all those suitors,  even your wife and son you left behind at home.  But you, you make your way to the swineherd first,  in charge of your pigs, and true to you as always,  loyal friend to your son, to Penelope, so self-possessed.  You'll find him posted beside his swine, grubbing round  by Raven's Rock and the spring called Arethusa,  rooting for feed that makes pigs sleek and fat,  the nuts they love, the dark pools they drink.  Wait there, sit with him, ask him all he knows.  I'm off to Sparta, where the women are a wonder,  to call Telemachus home, your own dear son, Odysseus. </p>

<p></p>

<p>He's journeyed to Lacedaemon's rolling hills  to see Menelaus, questing for news of you,  hoping to learn if you are still alive.&quot; </p>

<p>Shrewd Odysseus answered her at once:  &quot;Why not tell him the truth? You know it all.  Or is he too &mdash; like father, like son &mdash; condemned  to hardship, roving over the barren salt sea  while strangers devour our livelihood right here?&quot; </p>

<p>But the bright-eyed goddess reassured him firmly:  &quot;No need for anguish, trust me, not for AJw &mdash;  1 escorted your son myself  so he might make his name by sailing there.  Nor is he saddled down with any troubles now.  He sits at ease in the halls of Menelaus,  bathed in endless bounty ... True enough,  some young lords in a black cutter lurk in ambush,  poised to kill the prince before he reaches home,  but 1 have my doubts they will. Sooner the earth  will swallow down a few of those young gallants  who eat you out of house and home these days!&quot; </p>

<p>No more words, not now &mdash;  Athena stroked Odysseus with her wand.  She shriveled the supple skin on his lithe limbs,  stripped the russet curls from his head, covered his body  top to toe with the wrinkled hide of an old man  and dimmed the fire in his eyes, so shining once.  She turned his shirt and cloak into squalid rags,  ripped and filthy, smeared with grime and soot.  She flung over this the long pelt of a bounding deer,  rubbed bare, and gave him a staff and beggar's sack,  torn and tattered, slung from a fraying rope. </p>

<p>All plans made,  they went their separate ways &mdash; ^Athena setting off  to bring Telemachus home from hallowed Lacedaemon. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Book XIV </p>

<p></p>

<p>The Loyal  Swineherd </p>

<p></p>

<p>So up from the haven now Odysseus climbed a rugged path  through timber along high ground &mdash; ^Athena had shown the wag &mdash;  to reach the swineherd's place, that fine loyal man  who of all the household hands Odysseus ever had  cared the most for his master's worldly goods. </p>

<p>Sitting at the door of his lodge he found him,  there in his farmstead, high-walled, broad and large,  with its long view on its cleared rise of ground ...  The swineherd made those walls with his own hands  to enclose the pigs of his master gone for years.  Alone, apart from his queen or old Laertes,  he'd built them up of quarried blocks of stone  and coped them well with a fence of wild pear. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Outside he'd driven stakes in a long-line stockade, </p>

<p>a ring of thickset palings split from an oak's dark heart. </p>

<p>Within the yard he'd built twelve sties, side-by -side, </p>

<p>to bed his pigs, and in each one fifty brood-sows </p>

<p>slept aground, penned and kept for breeding. </p>

<p>The boars slept outside, but far fewer of them, </p>

<p>thanks to the lordly suitors' feasts that kept on </p>

<p>thinning the herd and kept the swineherd stepping, </p>

<p>sending to town each day the best fat hog in sight. </p>

<p>By now they were down to three hundred and sixty head. </p>

<p>But guarding them all the time were dogs like savage beasts, </p>

<p>a pack of four, reared by the swineherd, foreman of men. </p>

<p>The man himself was fitting sandals to his feet, </p>

<p>carving away at an oxhide, dark and supple. </p>

<p>As for his men, three were off with their pigs, </p>

<p>herding them here or there. Under orders he'd sent </p>

<p>a fourth to town, with hog in tow for the gorging suitors </p>

<p>to slaughter off and glut themselves with pork. </p>

<p>Suddenly &mdash; those snarling dogs spotted Odysseus,  charged him fast &mdash; a shatter of barks &mdash; but Odysseus  sank to the ground at once, he knew the trick:  the staff dropped from his hand but here and now,  on his own farm, he might have taken a shameful mauling.  Yes, but the swineherd, quick to move, dashed for the gate,  flinging his oxhide down, rushed the dogs with curses,  scattered them left and right with flying rocks  and warned his master, &quot;Lucky to be alive, old man &mdash;  a moment more, my pack would have torn you limb from limb!  Then you'd have covered me with shame. As if the gods  had never given me blows and groans aplenty ...  Here 1 sit, my heart aching, broken for him,  my master, my great king &mdash; fattening up  his own hogs for other men to eat, while he,  starving for food, 1 wager, wanders the earth,  a beggar adrift in strangers' cities, foreign-speaking lands,  if he's still alive, that is, still sees the rising sun.  Come, follow me into my place, old man, so you. </p>

<p></p>

<p>at least, can eat your fill of bread and wine.  Then you can tell me where you're from  and all the pains you've weathered.&quot; </p>

<p>On that note  the loyal swineherd led the way to his shelter,  showed his guest inside and sat Odysseus down  on brush and twigs he piled up for the visitor,  flinging over these the skin of a shaggy wild goat,  broad and soft, the swineherd's own good bedding.  The king, delighted to be so well received,  thanked the man at once: &quot;My host &mdash; may Zeus  and the other gods give you x^our heart's desire  for the royal welcome you have shown me here!&quot; </p>

<p>And you replied, Eumaeus, loyal swineherd,  &quot;It's wrong, my friend, to send any stranger packing &mdash;  even one who arrives in worse shape than you.  Every stranger and beggar comes from Zeus  and whatever scrap they get from the likes of us,  they'll find it welcome. That's the best we can do,  we servants, always cowed by our high and mighty masters,  especially our young lords ... But my old master?  The gods, they must have blocked his journey home.  He'd have treated me well, he would, with a house,  a plot of land and a wife you'd gladly prize.  Goods that a kind lord will give a household hand  who labors for him, hard, whose work the gods have sped,  just as they speed the work 1 labor at all day.  My master, 1 tell you, would have repaid me well  if he'd grown old right here. But now he's dead ...  If only Helen and all her kind had died out too,  brought to her knees, just as she cut the legs  from under troops of men! My king among them, </p>

<p>went off to the stallion-land of Troy  to fight the Trojans, save Agamemnon's honor!&quot; </p>

<p>Enough &mdash; </p>

<p>he brusquely cinched his belt around his shirt,  strode out to the pens, crammed with droves of pigs. </p>

<p></p>

<p>picked out two, bundled them in and slaughtered both,  singed them, sliced them down, skewered them through  and roasting all to a turn, set them before Odysseus,  sizzling hot on the spits. </p>

<p>Then coating the meat with white barley groats </p>

<p>and mixing honeyed wine in a carved wooden bowl, </p>

<p>he sat down across from his guest, inviting warmly, </p>

<p>&quot;Eat up now, my friend. It's all we slaves have got, </p>

<p>scrawny pork, while the suitors eat the fatted hogs &mdash; </p>

<p>no fear of the gods in theirhard hearts, no mercy! </p>

<p>Trust me, the blessed gods have no love for crime. </p>

<p>They honor justice, honor the decent acts of men. </p>

<p>Even cutthroat bandits who raid foreign parts &mdash; </p>

<p>and Zeus grants them a healthy share of plunder, </p>

<p>ships filled to the brim, and back they head for home &mdash; </p>

<p>even their dark hearts are stalked by the dread of vengeance. </p>

<p>But the suitors know, they've caught some godsent rumor </p>

<p>of master's grisly death! That's why they have no mind </p>

<p>to do their courting fairly or go back home in peace. </p>

<p>No, at their royal ease they devour all his goods, </p>

<p>those brazen rascals never spare a scrap! </p>

<p>Not a day or a night goes by, sent down by Zeus, </p>

<p>but they butcher victims, never stopping at one or two, </p>

<p>and drain his wine as if there's no tomorrow &mdash; </p>

<p>swilling the last drop ... </p>

<p>Believe me, my master's wealth was vast! </p>

<p>No other prince on earth could match his riches, </p>

<p>not on the loamy mainland or here at home in Ithaca &mdash; </p>

<p>no twenty men in the world could equal A/5 great treasures! </p>

<p>Let me count them off for you. A dozen herds of cattle </p>

<p>back on the mainland, just as many head of sheep, </p>

<p>as many droves of pigs and goatflocks ranging free; </p>

<p>hired hands or his own herdsmen keep them grazing there. </p>

<p>Here in Ithaca, goatflocks, eleven in all, scatter </p>

<p>to graze the island, out at the wild end, </p>

<p>and trusty goatherds watch their every move. </p>

<p>And each herdsman, day after day, it never ends, </p>

<p></p>

<p>drives in a beast for the suitors &mdash; best in sight,  a sheep or well-fed goat. While I tend to these pigs,  I guard them, pick the best for those carousers  and send it to the slaughter! &quot; </p>

<p>His voice rose  while the stranger ate his meat and drank his wine,  ravenous, bolting it all down in silence ...  brooding on ways to serve the suitors right.  But once he'd supped and refreshed himself with food,  he filled the wooden bowl he'd been drinking from,  brimmed it with wine and passed it to his host  who received the offer gladly, spirit cheered  as the stranger probed him now with winging words:  &quot;Friend, who was the man who bought you with his goods,  the master of such vast riches, powerful as you say?  You tell me he died defending Agamemnon's honor?  What's his name? 1 just might know such a man ...  Zeus would know, and the other deathless gods,  if 1 ever saw him, if 1 bring you any news.  I've roamed the whole earth over.&quot; </p>

<p>And the good swineherd answered, foreman of men,  &quot;Old friend, no wanderer landing here with news of him  is likely to win his wife and dear son over.  Random drifters, hungry for bed and board,  lie through their teeth and swallow back the truth.  Why, any tramp washed up on Ithaca's shores  scurries right to my mistress, babbling lies,  and she ushers him in, kindly, pressing for details,  and the warm tears of grief come trickling down her cheeks,  the loyal wife's way when her husband's died abroad.  Even you, old codger, could rig up some fine tale &mdash;  and soon enough, I'd say, </p>

<p>if they gave you shirt and clothing for your pains.  My master? Well, no doubt the dogs and wheeling birds  have ripped the skin from his ribs by now, his life is through &mdash;  or fish have picked him clean at sea, and the man's bones </p>

<p></p>

<p>lie piled up on the mainland, buried deep in sand ... </p>

<p>he's dead and gone. Aye, leaving a broken heart </p>

<p>for loved ones left behind, for /Tie most of all. </p>

<p>Never another master kind as he! </p>

<p>I'll never find one &mdash; no matter where 1 go, </p>

<p>not even if 1 went back to mother and father, </p>

<p>the house where 1 was born and my parents reared me once. </p>

<p>Ah, but much as 1 grieve for them, much as 1 long </p>

<p>to lay my eyes on them, set foot on the old soil, </p>

<p>it's longing for him, himXhdLX. wrings my heart &mdash; </p>

<p>Odysseus, lost and gone! </p>

<p>That man, old friend, far away as he is ... </p>

<p>1 can scarcely bear to say his name aloud, </p>

<p>so deeply he loved me, cared for me, so deeply. </p>

<p>Worlds away as he is, 1 call him Master, Brother!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;My friend,&quot; the great Odysseus, long in exile, answered,  &quot;since you are dead certain, since you still insist  he's never coming back, still the soul of denial,  1 won't simply say it &mdash; on my oath 1 swear  Odysseus is on his way!  Reward for such good news? Let me have it  the moment he sets foot in his own house,  dress me in shirt and cloak, in handsome clothes.  Before then, poor as 1 am, 1 wouldn't take a thing.  1 hate that man like the very Gates of Death who,  ground down by poverty, stoops to peddling lies.  1 swear by Zeus, the first of all the gods,  by this table of hospitality here, my host,  by Odysseus' hearth where 1 have come for help:  all will come to pass, 1 swear, exactly as 1 say.  True, this very month&mdash; just as the old moon dies  and the new moon rises into life &mdash; Odysseus will return!  He will come home and take revenge on any man  who offends his wedded wife and princely son!&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Good news,&quot; you replied, Eumaeus, loyal swineherd,  &quot;but 1 will never pay a reward for that, old friend &mdash;  Odysseus, he'll never come home again. Never ...  Drink your wine, sit back, let's talk of other things.  Don't remind me of all this. The heart inside me  breaks when anyone mentions my dear master.  That oath of yours, we'll let it pass &mdash; </p>

<p>Odysseus, </p>

<p>oh come back! &mdash; </p>

<p>just as /wish, 1 and Penelope,  old Laertes too, Telemachus too, the godlike boy.  How 1 grieve for himno^N, 1 can't stop &mdash; Odysseus' son,  Telemachus. The gods reared him up like a fine young tree  and 1 often said, Tn the ranks of men he'll match his father,  his own dear father &mdash; amazing in build and looks, that boy!'  But all of a sudden a god wrecks his sense of balance &mdash;  god or man, no matter &mdash; off he's gone to catch  some news of his father, down to holy Pylos.  And now those gallant suitors lie in wait for him,  sailing home, to tear the royal line of Arcesius  out of Ithaca, root and branch, good name and all!  Enough. Let Jii'm pass too &mdash; ^whether he's trapped  or the hand of Zeus will pull him through alive. </p>

<p>Come, </p>

<p>old soldier, tell me the story of your troubles, </p>

<p>tell me truly, too, I'd like to know it well ... </p>

<p>Who are you? where are you from? your city? your parents? </p>

<p>What sort of vessel brought you? Why did the sailors </p>

<p>land you here in Ithaca? Who did they say they are? </p>

<p>1 hardly think you came this way on foot.&quot; </p>

<p>The great teller of tales returned at length,  &quot;My story &mdash; ^the whole truth &mdash; I'm glad to tell it all.  If only the two of us had food and mellow wine  to last us long, here in your shelter now,  for us to sup on, undisturbed,  while others take the work of the world in hand,  1 could easily spend all year and never reach the end </p>

<p></p>

<p>of my endless story, all the heartbreaking trials  1 struggled through. The gods willed it so ... </p>

<p>1 hail from Crete's broad land, I'm proud to say,  and 1 am a rich man's son. And many other sons  he brought up in his palace, born in wedlock,  sprung of his lawful wife. Unlike my mother.  She was a slave, a concubine he'd purchased, yes,  but he treated me on a par with all his true-born sons &mdash;  Castor, Hylax' son. I'm proud to boast his blood, that man  revered like a god throughout all Crete those days,  for wealth, power and all his glorious offspring.  But the deadly spirits soon swept him down  to the House of Death, and his high and mighty sons  carved up his lands and then cast lots for the parts  and gave me just a pittance, a paltry house as well.  But 1 won myself a wife from wealthy, landed people,  thanks to my own strong points. 1 was no fool  and never shirked a fight. </p>

<p>But now my heyday's gone &mdash;  I've had my share of blows. Yet look hard at the husk  and you'll still see, 1 think, the grain that gave it life.  By heaven, Ares gave me courage, Athena too, to break  the ranks of men wide open, once, in the old days,  whenever 1 picked my troops and formed an ambush,  plotting attacks to spring against our foes &mdash;  no hint of death could daunt my fighting spirit!  Far out of the front I'd charge and spear my man,  I'd cut down any enemy soldier backing off.  Such was 1 in battle, true, but 1 had no love  for working the land, the chores of households either,  the labor that raises crops of shining children. No,  it was always oarswept ships that thrilled my heart,  and wars, and the long polished spears and arrows,  dreadful gear that makes the next man cringe.  1 loved them all &mdash; god planted that love inside me.  Each man delights in the work that suits him best. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Why, long before we Achaeans ever camped at Troy,  nine commands I led in our deep-sea-going ships,  raiding foreign men, and a fine haul reached my hands.  1 helped myself to the lion's share and still more  came by lot. And my house grew by leaps and bounds,  1 walked among the Cretans, honored, feared as well. </p>

<p>But then, when thundering Zeus contrived that expedition &mdash;  that disaster that brought so many fighters to their knees &mdash;  and men kept pressing me and renowned Idomeneus  to head a fleet to Troy, </p>

<p>there was no way out, no denying them then, </p>

<p>the voice of the people bore down much too hard. </p>

<p>So nine whole years we Achaeans soldiered on at Troy, </p>

<p>in the tenth we sacked King Priam's city, then embarked </p>

<p>for home in the long ships, and a god dispersed the fleet. </p>

<p>Unlucky me. Shrewd old Zeus was plotting still more pain. </p>

<p>No more than a month 1 stayed at home, taking joy </p>

<p>in my children, loyal wife and lovely plunder. </p>

<p>But a spirit in me urged, 'Set sail for Egypt &mdash; </p>

<p>fit out ships, take crews of seasoned heroes!' </p>

<p>Nine 1 fitted out, the men joined up at once </p>

<p>and then six days my shipmates feasted well, </p>

<p>while 1 provided a flock of sheep to offer up </p>

<p>to the gods and keep the feasters' table groaning. </p>

<p>On the seventh we launched out from the plains of Crete </p>

<p>with a stiff North Wind fair astern &mdash; smooth sailing, </p>

<p>aye, like coasting on downstream ... </p>

<p>And not one craft in our squadron foundered; </p>

<p>all shipshape, and all hands sound, we sat back </p>

<p>while the wind and helmsmen kept us true on course. </p>

<p>Five days out and we raised the great river Nile  and there in the Nile delta moored our ships of war.  God knows 1 ordered my trusty crews to stand by,  just where they were, and guard the anchored fleet  and 1 sent a patrol to scout things out from higher ground. </p>

<p></p>

<p>But swept away by their own reckless fury, the crew went berserk &mdash; </p>

<p>they promptly began to plunder the lush Egyptian farms, </p>

<p>dragged off the women and children, killed the men. </p>

<p>Outcries reached the city in no time &mdash; stirred by shouts </p>

<p>the entire town came streaming down at the break of day, </p>

<p>filling the river plain with chariots, ranks of infantry </p>

<p>and the gleam of bronze. Zeus who loves the lightning </p>

<p>flung down murderous panic on all my men-at-arms &mdash; </p>

<p>no one dared to stand his ground and fight, </p>

<p>disaster ringed us round from every quarter. </p>

<p>Droves of my men they hacked down with swords, </p>

<p>led off the rest alive, to labor for them as slaves. </p>

<p>And 1? Zeus flashed an inspiration through my mind, </p>

<p>though 1 wish I'd died a soldier down in Egypt then! </p>

<p>A world of pain, you see, still lay in wait for me ... </p>

<p>Quickly 1 wrenched the skullcap helmet off my head, </p>

<p>1 tore the shield from my back and dropped my spear </p>

<p>and ran right into the path of the king's chariot, </p>

<p>hugged and kissed his knees. He pitied me, spared me, </p>

<p>hoisted me onto his war-car, took me home in tears. </p>

<p>Troops of his men came rushing after, shaking javelins, </p>

<p>mad to kill me &mdash; ^their fighting blood at the boil &mdash; </p>

<p>but their master drove them off. </p>

<p>He feared the wrath of Zeus, the god of guests, </p>

<p>the first of the gods to pay back acts of outrage. </p>

<p>So, </p>

<p>there 1 lingered for seven years, amassing a fortune  from all the Egyptian people loading me with gifts.  Then, at last, when the eighth had come full turn,  along comes this Phoenician one fine day ...  a scoundrel, swindler, an old hand at lies  who'd already done the world a lot of damage.  Well, he smoothly talked me round and off we sailed,  Phoenicia-bound, where his house and holdings lay.  There in his care 1 stayed till the year was out.  Then, when the months and days had run their course  and the year wheeled round and the seasons came again,  he conned me aboard his freighter bound for Libya, </p>

<p></p>

<p>pretending I'd help him ship a cargo there for sale </p>

<p>but in fact he'd sell meihere and make a killing! </p>

<p>1 suspected as much, of course, but had no choice, </p>

<p>so 1 boarded with him, yes, and the ship ran on </p>

<p>with a good strong North Wind gusting &mdash; </p>

<p>fast on the middle passage clear of Crete &mdash; </p>

<p>but Zeus was brewing mischief for that crew ... </p>

<p>Once we'd left the island in our wake &mdash; </p>

<p>no land at all in sight, nothing but sea and sky &mdash; </p>

<p>then Zeus the son of Cronus mounted a thunderhead </p>

<p>above our hollow ship and the deep went black beneath it. </p>

<p>Then, then in the same breath Zeus hit the craft </p>

<p>with a lightning-bolt and thunder. Round she spun, </p>

<p>reeling under the impact, filled with reeking brimstone, </p>

<p>shipmates pitching out of her, bobbing round like seahawks </p>

<p>swept along by the breakers past the trim black hull &mdash; </p>

<p>and the god cut short their journey home forever. </p>

<p>Not mine. </p>

<p>Zeus himself &mdash; when 1 was just at the final gasp &mdash; </p>

<p>thrust the huge mast of my dark-prowed vessel </p>

<p>right into my arms so 1 might flee disaster </p>

<p>one more time. Wrapping myself around it, </p>

<p>1 was borne along by the wretched galewinds, </p>

<p>rushed along nine days &mdash; on the tenth, at dead of night, </p>

<p>a shouldering breaker rolled me up along Thesprotia's beaches. </p>

<p>There the king of Thesprotia, Phidon, my salvation, </p>

<p>treated me kindly, asked for no reward at all. </p>

<p>His own good son had found me, half-dead </p>

<p>from exhaustion and the cold. He raised me up </p>

<p>by the hand and led me home to his father's house </p>

<p>and dressed me in cloak and shirt and decent clothes. </p>

<p>That's where 1 first got wind of AJm &mdash; Odysseus ... </p>

<p>The king told me he'd hosted the man in style, </p>

<p>befriended him on his way home to native land, </p>

<p>and showed me all the treasure Odysseus had amassed. </p>

<p>Bronze and gold and plenty of hard wrought iron, </p>

<p>enough to last a man and ten generations of his heirs &mdash; </p>

<p>so great the wealth stored up for Jn'm in the king's vaults! </p>

<p></p>

<p>But Odysseus, he made clear, was off at Dodona then  to hear the will of Zeus that rustles forth  from the god's tall leafy oak: how should he return,  after all the years away, to his own green land of Ithaca &mdash;  openly or in secret? Phidon swore to me, what's more,  as the princely man poured out libations in his house,  The ship's hauled down and the crew set to sail,  to take Odysseus home to native land.' </p>

<p>Butl... </p>

<p>he shipped me off before. A Thesprotian cutter </p>

<p>chanced to be heading for Dulichion rich in wheat, </p>

<p>so he told the crew to take me to the king, Acastus, </p>

<p>treat me kindly, too, but it pleased them more </p>

<p>to scheme foul play against me, </p>

<p>sink me into the very depths of pain. As soon </p>

<p>as the ship was far off land, scudding in mid-sea, </p>

<p>they sprang their trap &mdash; my day of slavery then and there! </p>

<p>They stripped from my back the shirt and cloak 1 wore, </p>

<p>decked me out in a new suit of clothes, all rags, </p>

<p>ripped and filthy &mdash; the rags you see right now. </p>

<p>But then, once they'd gained the fields of Ithaca, </p>

<p>still clear in the evening light, they lashed me fast </p>

<p>to the rowing-benches, twisting a cable round me; </p>

<p>all hands went ashore </p>

<p>and rushed to catch their supper on the beach. </p>

<p>But the gods themselves unhitched my knots at once </p>

<p>with the gods' own ease. 1 wrapped my head in rags, </p>

<p>slid down the gangplank polished smooth, slipped my body </p>

<p>into the water, not a splash, chest-high, then quick, </p>

<p>launched out with both my arms and swam away &mdash; </p>

<p>out of the surf in no time, clear of the crew. </p>

<p>1 clambered upland, into a flowery, fragrant brush </p>

<p>and crouched there, huddling low. They raised a hue and cry, </p>

<p>wildly beat the bushes, but when it seemed no use </p>

<p>to pursue the hunt, back they trudged again and </p>

<p>boarded their empty ship. </p>

<p>The gods hid me themselves &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>it's light work for them &mdash; and brought me here,  the homestead of a man who knows the world.  So it seems to be my lot that I'll live on. &quot; </p>

<p>And you replied, Eumaeus, loyal swineherd,  &quot;So much misery, friend! You've moved my heart,  deeply, with your long tale ... such blows, such roving.  But one part's off the mark, 1 know &mdash; you'll never persuade me &mdash;  what you say about Odysseus. A man in your condition,  who are you, 1 ask you, to lie for no good reason?  Well 1 know the truth of my good lord's return,  how the gods detested him, with a vengeance &mdash;  never letting him go under, fighting Trojans,  or die in the arms of loved ones,  once he'd wound down the long coil of war.  Then all united Achaea would have raised his tomb  and he'd have won his son great fame for years to come.  But now the whirlwinds have ripped him away &mdash; no fame for him.  And 1 live here, cut off from the world, with all my pigs.  I never go into town unless, perhaps, wise Penelope  calls me back, when news drops in from nowhere.  There they crowd the messenger, cross-examine him,  heartsick for their long-lost lord or all too glad  to eat him out of house and home, scot-free.  But I've no love for all that probing, prying,  not since some Aetolian fooled me with his yarn.  He'd killed a man, wandered over the face of the earth,  stumbled onto my hut, and 1 received him warmly.  He told me he'd seen Odysseus  lodged with King Idomeneus down in Crete &mdash;  refitting his ships, hard-hit by the gales,  but he'd be home, he said, by summer or harvest-time,  his hulls freighted with treasure, manned by fighting crews.  So you, old misery, seeing a god has led you here to me,  don't try to charm me now, don't spellbind /newith lies!  Never for that^N\\\ 1 respect you, treat you kindly;  no, it's my fear of Zeus, the god of guests. </p>

<p></p>

<p>and because I pity you ...&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Good god, &quot; the crafty man pressed on,  &quot;what a dark, suspicious heart you have inside you!  Not even my oath can win you over, make you see the light.  Come, strike a bargain &mdash; all the gods of Olympus  witness now our pact!  If your master returns, here to your house,  dress me in shirt and cloak and send me off  to Dulichion at once, the place 1 long to be.  But if your master doesn't return as 1 predict,  set your men on me &mdash; fling me off some rocky crag  so the next beggar here may just think twice  before he peddles lies. &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Surely, friend!&quot;&mdash;  the swineherd shook his head &mdash; &quot;and just think  of the praise and fame I'd win among mankind,  now and for all time to come, if first 1 took you  under my roof, 1 treated you kindly as my guest  then cut you down and robbed you of your life &mdash;  how keen I'd be to say my prayers to Zeus!  But it's high time for a meal.  1 hope the men will come home any moment  so we can fix a tasty supper in the lodge. &quot; </p>

<p>As host and guest confided back and forth  the herdsmen came in, driving their hogs up close,  penning sows in their proper sties for the night,  squealing for all they're worth, shut inside their yard,  and the good swineherd shouted to his men,  &quot;Bring in your fattest hog!  I'll slaughter it for our guest from far abroad.  We'll savor it ourselves. All too long we've sweated  over these white-tusked boars &mdash; our wretched labor &mdash;  while others wolf our work down free of charge!&quot; </p>

<p>Calling out </p>

<p>as he split up kindling now with a good sharp ax  and his men hauled in a tusker five years old. </p>

<p></p>

<p>rippling fat, and stood him steady by the hearth. </p>

<p>The swineherd, soul of virtue, did not forget the gods. </p>

<p>He began the rite by plucking tufts from the porker's head, </p>

<p>threw them into the fire and prayed to all the powers, </p>

<p>&quot;Bring him home, our wise Odysseus, home at last!&quot; </p>

<p>Then raising himself full-length, with an oak log </p>

<p>he'd left unsplit he clubbed and stunned the beast </p>

<p>and it gasped out its life ... </p>

<p>The men slashed its throat, singed the carcass, </p>

<p>quickly quartered it all, and then the swineherd, </p>

<p>cutting first strips for the gods from every limb, </p>

<p>spread them across the thighs, wrapped in sleek fat, </p>

<p>and sprinkling barley over them, flung them on the fire. </p>

<p>They sliced the rest into pieces, pierced them with skewers, </p>

<p>broiled them all to a turn and, pulling them off the spits, </p>

<p>piled the platters high. The swineherd, standing up </p>

<p>to share the meat &mdash; his sense of fairness perfect &mdash; </p>

<p>carved it all out into seven equal portions. </p>

<p>One he set aside, lifting up a prayer </p>

<p>to the forest nymphs and Hermes, Maia's son, </p>

<p>and the rest he handed on to each man in turn. </p>

<p>But to Odysseus he presented the boar's long loin </p>

<p>and the cut of honor cheered his master's heart. </p>

<p>The man for all occasions thanked his host: </p>

<p>&quot;1 pray, Eumaeus, you'll be as dear to Father Zeus </p>

<p>as you are to me &mdash; a man in my condition &mdash; </p>

<p>you honor me by giving me your best.&quot; </p>

<p>You replied in kind, Eumaeus, swineherd:  &quot;Eat, my strange new friend ... enjoy it now,  it's all we have to offer. As for Father Zeus,  one thing he will give and another he'll hold back,  whatever his pleasure. All things are in his power.&quot; </p>

<p>He burned choice parts for the gods who never die  and pouring glistening wine in a full libation,  placed the cup in his guest's hands &mdash; Odysseus,  raider of cities &mdash; and down he sat to his own share. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Mesaulius served them bread, a man the swineherd  purchased for himself in his master's absence &mdash;  alone, apart from his queen or old Laertes &mdash;  bought him from Taphians, bartered his own goods.  They reached out for the spread that lay at hand  and when they'd put aside desire for food and drink,  Mesaulius cleared the things away. And now, content  with bread and meat, they made for bed at once. </p>

<p>A foul night came on &mdash; the dark of the moon &mdash; and Zeus  rained from dusk to dawn and a sodden West Wind raged.  Odysseus spoke up now, keen to test the swineherd.  Would he take his cloak off, hand it to his guest  or at least tell one of his men to do the same?  He cared for the stranger so, who ventured now,  &quot;Listen, Eumaeus, and all you comrades here,  allow me to sing my praises for a moment.  Say it's the wine that leads me on, the wild wine  that sets the wisest man to sing at the top of his lungs,  laugh like a fool &mdash; it drives the man to dancing ... it even  tempts him to blurt out stories better never told.  But now that I'm sounding off, 1 can't hold back.  Oh make me young again, and the strength inside me  steady as a rock! Just as 1 was that day  we sprang a sudden ambush against the Trojans.  Odysseus led the raid with Atreus' son Menelaus.  1 was third in command &mdash; they'd chosen me themselves.  Once we'd edged up under the city's steep ramparts,  crowding the walls but sinking into the thick brake,  the reeds and marshy flats, huddling under our armor  there we lay, and a foul night came on, the North Wind struck,  freezing cold, and down from the skies the snow fell like frost,  packed hard &mdash; ^the rims of our shields armored round with ice.  There all the rest of the men wore shirts and cloaks and,  hunching shields over their shoulders, slept at ease.  Not 1. I'd left my cloak at camp when 1 set out- &mdash;  idiot &mdash; never thinking it might turn cold,  so 1 joined in with just the shield on my back </p>

<p></p>

<p>and a shining waist-guard ... But then at last,  the night's third watch, the stars just wheeling down &mdash;  I muttered into his ear, Odysseus, right beside me,  nudging him with an elbow &mdash; he perked up at once &mdash;  'Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, full of tactics,  I'm not long for the living. The cold will do me in.  See, I've got no cloak. Some spirit's fooled me &mdash;  1 came out half-dressed. Now there's no escape!'  1 hadn't finished &mdash; a thought flashed in his mind;  no one could touch the man at plots or battles.  'Shhh!' he hissed back &mdash; Odysseus had a plan &mdash;  'One of our fighters over there might hear you.'  Then he propped his head on his forearm, calling out,  'Friends, wake up. 1 slept and a god sent down a dream.  It warned that we're too far from the ships, exposed.  Go, someone, tell Agamemnon, our field marshal &mdash;  he might rush reinforcements from the beach.'  Thoas, son of Andraemon, sprang up at once,  flung off his purple cloak and ran to the ships  while 1, bundling into his wrap, was glad at heart  till Dawn rose on her golden throne once more.  Oh make me young again  and the strength inside me steady as a rock!  One of the swineherds here would lend a wrap,  for love of a good soldier, respect as well.  Now they spurn me, dressed in filthy rags.&quot; </p>

<p>And you replied, Eumaeus, loyal swineherd,  &quot;Now tAatynas a fine yarn you told, old-timer,  not without point, not without profit either.  You won't want for clothes or whatever else  is due a worn-out traveler come for help &mdash;  not for tonight at least. Tomorrow morning  you'll have to flap around in rags again.  Here we've got no store of shirts and cloaks,  no changes. Just one wrap per man, that's all.  But just you wait till Odysseus' dear son comes back &mdash;  that boy will deck you out in a cloak and shirt </p>

<p></p>

<p>and send you off, wherever your heart desires!&quot; </p>

<p>With that </p>

<p>he rose to his feet, laid out a bed by the fire,  throwing over it skins of sheep and goats and  down Odysseus lay. Eumaeus flung on his guest  the heavy flaring cloak he kept in reserve  to wear when winter brought some wild storm. </p>

<p>So here </p>

<p>Odysseus slept and the young hands slept beside him.  Not the swineherd. Not his style to bed indoors,  apart from his pigs. He geared up to go outside  and it warmed Odysseus' heart,  Eumaeus cared so much for his absent master's goods.  First, over his broad shoulders he slung a whetted sword,  wrapped himself in a cloak stitched tight to block the wind,  and adding a cape, the pelt of a shaggy well-fed goat,  he took a good sharp lance to fight off men and dogs.  Then out he went to sleep where his white-tusked boars  had settled down for the night ... just under  a jutting crag that broke the North Wind's blast. </p>

<p>Book XV </p>

<p></p>

<p>The Prince Sets Sail  for Home </p>

<p>Now south through the spacious dancing-rings of Lacedaemon </p>

<p>Athena went to remind the hero's princely son </p>

<p>of his journey home and spur him on his way. </p>

<p>She found him there with Nestor's gallant son, </p>

<p>bedded down in the porch of illustrious Menelaus &mdash; </p>

<p>Pisistratus, at least overcome with deep sound sleep, </p>

<p>but not Telemachus. Welcome sleep could not hold him. </p>

<p>All through the godsent night he lay awake ... </p>

<p>tossing with anxious thoughts about his father. </p>

<p>Hovering over him, eyes ablaze, Athena said, </p>

<p>&quot;It's wrong, Telemachus, wrong to rove so far, </p>

<p>so long from home, leaving your own holdings </p>

<p>unprotected &mdash; crowds in your palace so brazen </p>

<p>they'll carve up all your wealth, devour it all, </p>

<p>and then your journey here will come to nothing. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Quickly, press Menelaus, lord of the warcry ,  to speed you home at once, if you want to find  your irreproachable mother still inside your house.  Even now her father and brothers urge Penelope  to marry Eurymachus, who excels all other suitors  at giving gifts and drives the bride-price higher.  She must not carry anything off against your will!  You know how the heart of a woman always works:  she likes to build the wealth of her new groom &mdash;  of the sons she bore, of her dear, departed husband,  not a memory of the dead, no questions asked.  So sail for home, 1 say! </p>

<p>With your own hands turn over all your goods  to the one serving-woman you can trust the most,  till the gods bring to light your own noble bride. </p>

<p>And another thing. Take it to heart, 1 tell you.  Picked men of the suitors lie in ambush, grim-set  in the straits between Ithaca and rocky Same,  poised to kill you before you can reach home,  but 1 have my doubts they will. Sooner the earth  will swallow down a few of those young gallants  who eat you out of house and home these days!  Just give the channel islands a wide berth,  push on in your trim ship, sail night and day,  and the deathless god who guards and pulls you through  will send you a fresh fair wind from hard astern.  At your first landfall, Ithaca's outer banks,  speed ship and shipmates round to the city side.  But you &mdash; you make your way to the swineherd first,  in charge of your pigs, and true to you as always.  Sleep the night there, send him to town at once  to tell the news to your mother, wise Penelope &mdash;  you've made it back from Pylos safe and sound.&quot; </p>

<p>Mission accomplished, back she went to Olympus' heights  as Telemachus woke Nestor's son from his sweet sleep;  he dug a heel in his ribs and roused him briskly: </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Up, Pisistratus. Hitch the team to the chariot &mdash;  let's head for home at once!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No, Telemachus,&quot;  Nestor's son objected, &quot;much as we long to go,  we cannot drive a team in the dead of night.  Morning will soon be here. So wait, I say,  wait till he loads our chariot down with gifts &mdash;  the hero Atrides, Menelaus, the great spearman &mdash;  and gives us warm salutes and sees us off like princes.  That's the man a guest will remember all his days:  the lavish host who showers him with kindness. &quot; </p>

<p>At those words Dawn rose on her golden throne  and Menelaus, lord of the warcry , rising up from bed  by the side of Helen with her loose and lovely hair,  walked toward his guests. As soon as he saw him,  Telemachus rushed to pull a shimmering tunic on,  over his broad shoulders threw his flaring cape  and the young prince, son of King Odysseus,  strode out to meet his host: &quot;Menelaus,  royal son of Atreus, captain of armies,  let me go back to my own country now.  The heart inside me longs for home at last.&quot; </p>

<p>The lord of the warcry reassured the prince,  &quot;I'd never detain you here too long, Telemachus,  not if your heart is set on going home.  I'd find fault with another host, I'm sure,  too warm to his guests, too pressing or too cold.  Balance is best in all things. It's bad either way,  spurring the stranger home who wants to linger,  holding the one who longs to leave &mdash; you know,  'Welcome the coming, speed the parting guest!'  But wait till 1 load your chariot down with gifts &mdash;  fine ones, too, you'll see with your own eyes &mdash;  and tell the maids to serve a meal at hall.  We have god's plenty here.  It's honor and glory to us, a help to you as well. </p>

<p></p>

<p>if you dine in style first, then leave to see the world.  And if you're keen for the grand tour of all Hellas,  right to the depths of Argos, I'll escort you myself,  harness the horses, guide you through the towns.  And no host will turn us away with empty hands,  each will give us at least one gift to prize &mdash;  a handsome tripod, cauldron forged in bronze,  a brace of mules or a solid golden cup.&quot; </p>

<p>Firmly resolved, Telemachus replied,  &quot;Menelaus, royal Atrides, captain of armies,  1 must go back to my own home at once.  When 1 started out 1 left no one behind  to guard my own possessions. God forbid,  searching for my great father, 1 lose my life  or lose some priceless treasure from my house!&quot; </p>

<p>As soon as the lord of the warcry heard that,  he told his wife and serving-women to lay out a meal  in the hall at once. They'd stores aplenty there.  Eteoneus, son of Boethous, came to join them &mdash;  fresh from bed, he lived close by the palace.  The warlord Menelaus told him to build a fire  and broil some meat. He quickly did his bidding.  Down Atrides walked to a storeroom filled with scent,  and not alone: Helen and Megapenthes went along.  Reaching the spot where all the heirlooms lay,  Menelaus chose a generous two-handled cup;  he told his son Megapenthes to take a mixing-bowl,  solid silver, while Helen lingered beside the chests,  and there they were, brocaded, beautiful robes  her own hands had woven. Queenly Helen,  radiance of women, lifted one from the lot,  the largest, loveliest robe, and richly worked  and like a star it glistened, deep beneath the others.  Then all three went up and on through the halls until  they found Telemachus. The red-haired king spoke out:  &quot;Oh my boy, may Zeus the Thunderer, Hera's lord. </p>

<p></p>

<p>grant you the journey home your heart desires!  Of all the treasures lying heaped in my palace  you shall have the finest, most esteemed. Look,  I'll give you this mixing-bowl, forged to perfection &mdash;  it's solid silver finished off with a lip of gold.  Hephaestus made it himself. And a royal friend,  Phaedimus, king of Sidon, lavished it on me  when his palace welcomed me on passage home.  How pleased I'd be if you took it as a gift! &quot; </p>

<p>And the warlord placed the two-eared cup  in his hands while stalwart Megapenthes carried in  the glittering silver bowl and set it down before him.  Helen, her cheeks flushed with beauty, moved beside him,  holding the robe in her arms, and offered, warmly,  &quot;Here, dear boy, 1 too have a gift to give you,  a keepsake of Helen &mdash; 1 wove it with my hands &mdash;  for your own bride to wear  when the blissful day of marriage dawns ...  Until then, let it rest in your mother's room.  And may you return in joy &mdash; my parting wish &mdash;  to your own grand house, your native land at last.&quot; </p>

<p>With that </p>

<p>she laid the robe in his arms, and he received it gladly. </p>

<p>Prince Pisistratus, taking the gifts, stowed them deep </p>

<p>in the chariot cradle, viewed them all with wonder. </p>

<p>The red-haired warlord led them back to his house </p>

<p>and the guests took seats on low and high-backed chairs. </p>

<p>A maid brought water soon in a graceful golden pitcher </p>

<p>and over a silver basin tipped it out </p>

<p>so they might rinse their hands, </p>

<p>then pulled a gleaming table to their side. </p>

<p>A staid housekeeper brought on bread to serve them, </p>

<p>appetizers aplenty too, lavish with her bounty. </p>

<p>Ready Eteoneus carved and passed the meat, </p>

<p>the son of illustrious Menelaus poured their wine. </p>

<p>They reached out for the good things that lay at hand </p>

<p>and once they 'd put aside desire for food and drink. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Prince Telemachus and the gallant son of Nestor  yoked their team, mounted the blazoned car  and drove through the gates and echoing colonnade.  The red-haired King Menelaus followed both boys out,  his right hand holding a golden cup of honeyed wine  so the two might pour libations forth at parting.  Just in front of the straining team he strode,  lifting his cup and pledging both his guests:  &quot;Farewell, my princes! Give my warm greetings  to Nestor, the great commander,  always kind to me as a father, long ago  when we young men of Achaea fought at Troy.&quot; </p>

<p>And tactful Telemachus replied at once,  &quot;Surely, my royal host, we'll tell him all,  as soon as we reach old Nestor &mdash; all you say.  1 wish 1 were just as sure I'd find Odysseus  waiting there at home when 1 reach Ithaca.  I'd tell him 1 come from you,  treated with so much kindness at your hands,  loaded down with all these priceless gifts!&quot; </p>

<p>At his last words a bird flew past on the right,  an eagle clutching a huge white goose in its talons,  plucked from the household yards. And all rushed after,  shouting, men and women, and swooping toward the chariot now  the bird veered off to the right again before the horses.  All looked up, overjoyed &mdash; people's spirits lifted.  Nestor's son Pisistratus spoke out first:  &quot;Look there! King Menelaus, captain of armies,  what, did the god send down that sign for you  or the two of us?' </p>

<p>The warlord fell to thinking &mdash;  how to read the omen rightly, how to reply? ...  But long-robed Helen stepped in well before him:  &quot;Listen to me and 1 will be your prophet,  sure as the gods have flashed it in my mind  and it will come to pass, 1 know it will. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Just as the eagle swooped down from the crags  where it was born and bred, just as it snatched  that goose fattened up for the kill inside the house,  so, after many trials and roving long and hard,  Odysseus will descend on his house and take revenge &mdash;  unless he's home already, sowing seeds of ruin  for that whole crowd of suitors! &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Oh if only,&quot; </p>

<p>pensive Telemachus burst out in thanks to Helen,  &quot;Zeus the thundering lord of Hera makes it so &mdash;  even at home I'll pray to you as a deathless goddess!&quot; </p>

<p>He cracked the lash and the horses broke quickly,  careering through the city out into open country,  shaking the yoke across their shoulders all day long. </p>

<p>The sun sank and the roads of the world grew dark  as they reached Phera, pulling up to Diodes' halls,  the son of Ortilochus, son of the Alpheus River.  He gave them a royal welcome; there they slept the night. </p>

<p>When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more  they yoked their pair again, mounted the blazoned car  and out through the gates and echoing colonnade  they whipped the team to a run and on they flew,  holding nothing back, approaching Pylos soon,  the craggy citadel. That was when Telemachus  turned to Pisistratus, saying, &quot;Son of Nestor,  won't you do as 1 ask you, see it through?  We're friends for all our days now, so we claim,  thanks to our fathers' friendship. We're the same age as well  and this tour of ours has made us more like brothers.  Prince, don't drive me past my vessel, drop me there.  Your father's old, in love with his hospitality;  1 fear he'll hold me, chafing in his palace &mdash;  1 must hurry home!&quot; </p>

<p>The son of Nestor pondered ...  how to do it properly, see it through? </p>

<p></p>

<p>Pausing a moment, then this way seemed best.  Swerving his team, he drove down to the ship  tied up on shore and loaded into her stern  the splendid gifts, the robes and gold Menelaus gave,  and sped his friend with a flight of winging words:  &quot;Climb aboard now &mdash; fast! Muster all your men  before 1 get home and break the news to father.  With that man's overbearing spirit &mdash; 1 know it,  know it all too well &mdash; he'll never let you go,  he'll come down here and summon you himself.  He won't return without you, believe me;  in any case he'll fly into a rage.&quot; </p>

<p>With that warning he whipped his sleek horses  back to Pylos city and reached his house in no time.  Telemachus shouted out commands to all his shipmates:  &quot;Stow our gear, my comrades, deep in the holds  and board at once &mdash; we must be on our way!&quot; </p>

<p>His shipmates snapped to orders,  swung aboard and sat to the oars in ranks.  But just as Telemachus prepared to launch,  praying, sacrificing to Pallas by the stern,  a man from a far-off country came toward him now,  a fugitive out of Argos: he had killed a man ...  He was a prophet, sprung of Melampus' line of seers,  Melampus who lived in Pylos, mother of flocks, some years ago,  rich among his Pylians, at home in his great high house  until he was made to go abroad to foreign parts,  fleeing his native land and hot-blooded Neleus &mdash;  most imperious man alive &mdash; ^who'd commandeered  his vast estate and held it down by force  for one entire year. That year Melampus,  bound by cruel chains in the halls of Phylacus,  suffered agonies &mdash; all for Neleus' daughter Pero,  that and the mad spell a Fury, murderous spirit,  cast upon his mind. But the seer worked free of death </p>

<p></p>

<p>and drove the lusty, bellowing cattle out of Phylace, </p>

<p>back to Pylos. There he avenged himself on Neleus </p>

<p>for the shameful thing the king had done to him, </p>

<p>and escorted Pero home as his brother's bride. </p>

<p>But he himself went off to a distant country, </p>

<p>Argos, land of stallions &mdash; his destined home </p>

<p>where he would live and rule the Argive nation. </p>

<p>Here he married a wife and built a high-roofed house </p>

<p>and sired Antiphates and Mantius, two staunch sons. </p>

<p>Antiphates fathered Oicles, gallant heart, </p>

<p>Oicles fathered Amphiaraus, driver of armies, </p>

<p>whom storming Zeus and Apollo loved intensely, </p>

<p>showering him with every form of kindness. </p>

<p>But he never reached the threshold of old age, </p>

<p>he died at Thebes &mdash; undone by a bribe his wife accepted &mdash; </p>

<p>leaving behind his two sons, Alcmaeon and Amphilochus. </p>

<p>On his side Mantius sired Polyphides and Clitus both </p>

<p>but Dawn of the golden throne whisked Clitus away, </p>

<p>overwhelmed by his beauty, </p>

<p>so the boy would live among the deathless gods. </p>

<p>Yet Apollo made magnanimous Polyphides a prophet &mdash; </p>

<p>after Amphiaraus' death &mdash; the greatest seer on earth. </p>

<p>But a feud with his father drove him off to Hyperesia </p>

<p>where he made his home and prophesied to the world ... </p>

<p>This prophet's son it was &mdash; ^Theocly menus his name &mdash;  who approached Telemachus now and found him pouring  wine to a god and saying prayers beside his ship.  &quot;Friend,&quot; he said in a winging supplication,  &quot;since 1 find you burning offerings here,  1 beg you by these rites and the god you pray to,  then by your own life and the lives of all the men  who travel with you &mdash; ^tell me truly, don't hold back,  who are you? where are you from? your city? your parents?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Of course, stranger, &quot; the forthright prince responded,  &quot;1 will tell you everything, clearly as 1 can. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Ithaca is my country. Odysseus is my father &mdash;  there was a man, or was he all a dream? ...  but he's surely died a wretched death by now.  Yet here I've come with my crew and black ship,  out for news of my father, lost and gone so long.&quot; </p>

<p>And the godlike seer Theoclymenus replied,  &quot;Just like you, I too have left my land &mdash;  I because I killed a man of my own tribe.  But he has many brothers and kin in Argos,  stallion-land, who rule the plains in force.  Fleeing death at their hands, a dismal fate,  1 am a fugitive now, </p>

<p>doomed to wander across this mortal world. </p>

<p>So take me aboard, hear a fugitive's prayer: </p>

<p>don't let them kill me &mdash; they're after me, well 1 know!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;So desperate! &quot; thoughtful Telemachus exclaimed.  &quot;How could 1 drive you from my ship? Come sail with us,  we'll tend you at home, with all we can provide.&quot; </p>

<p>And he took the prophet's honed bronze spear,  laid it down full-length on the rolling deck,  swung aboard the deep-sea craft himself,  assuming the pilot's seat reserved astern  and put the seer beside him. Cables cast off,  Telemachus shouted out commands to all his shipmates:  &quot;All lay hands to tackle!&quot; They sprang to orders,  hoisting the pinewood mast, they stepped it firm  in its block amidships, lashed it fast with stays  and with braided rawhide halyards hauled the white sail high.  Now bright-eyed Athena sent them a stiff following wind  blustering out of a clear sky, gusting on so the ship  might run its course through the salt sea at top speed &mdash;  and past the Springs she raced and the Chalcis' rushing stream  as the sun sank and the roads of the world grew dark and  on she pressed for Pheae, driven on by a wind from Zeus  and flew past lovely Elis, where Epeans rule in power. </p>

<p></p>

<p>and then Telemachus veered for the Jagged Islands, </p>

<p>wondering all the way &mdash; </p>

<p>would he sweep clear of death or be cut down? </p>

<p>The king and loyal swineherd, just that night,  were supping with other fleldhands in the lodge.  Once they 'd put aside desire for food and drink,  Odysseus spoke up, eager to test the swineherd,  see if he'd stretch out his warm welcome now,  invite him to stay on in the farmstead here  or send him off to town. &quot;Listen, Eumaeus,  all you comrades here &mdash; at the crack of dawn  1 mean to go to town and do my begging,  not be a drain on you and all your men.  But advise me well, give me a trusty guide  to see me there. And then I'm on my own  to roam the streets &mdash; 1 must, 1 have no choice &mdash;  hoping to find a handout, just a crust or cupful.  I'd really like to go to the house of King Odysseus  and give my news to his cautious queen, Penelope.  Why, I'd even mix with those overweening suitors &mdash;  would they spare me a plateful? Look at all they have!  I'd do good work for them, promptly, anything they want.  Let me tell you, listen closely, catch my drift ...  Thanks to Hermes the guide, who gives all work  of our hands the grace and fame that it deserves,  no one alive can match me at household chores:  building a good fire, splitting kindling neatly,  carving, roasting meat and pouring rounds of wine ...  anything menials do to serve their noble masters.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;God's sake, my friend!&quot; you broke in now,  Eumaeus, loyal swineherd, deeply troubled.  &quot;What's got into your head, what crazy plan?  You must be hell-bent on destruction, on the spot,  if you're keen to mingle with that mob of suitors &mdash;  their pride and violence hit the iron skies!  They 're a far cry from you, </p>

<p></p>

<p>the men who do their bidding. Young bucks,  all rigged out in their fine robes and shirts,  hair sleeked down with oil, faces always beaming,  the ones who slave for them/The tables polished,  sagging under the bread and meat and wine.  No, stay here. No one finds you a burden,  surely not 1, not any comrade here.  You wait till Odysseus' dear son comes back &mdash;  that boy will deck you out in a cloak and shirt  and send you off, wherever your heart desires! &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;If only, Eumaeus,&quot; the wayworn exile said,  &quot;you were as dear to Father Zeus as you are to me!  You who stopped my pain, my endless, homesick roving.  Tramping about the world &mdash; there's nothing worse for a man.  But the fact is that men put up with misery  to stuff their cursed bellies.  But seeing you hold me here, urging me now  to wait for AJm, the prince who's on his way,  tell me about the mother of King Odysseus, please,  the father he left as well &mdash; on the threshold of old age &mdash;  when he sailed off to war. Are they still alive,  perhaps, still looking into the light of day?  Or dead by now, and down in Death's long house?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Friend,&quot; </p>

<p>the swineherd, foreman of men, assured his guest, </p>

<p>&quot;I'll tell you the whole story, point by point. </p>

<p>Laertes is still alive, but night and day </p>

<p>he prays to Zeus, waiting there in his house, </p>

<p>for the life breath to slip away and leave his body. </p>

<p>His heart's so racked for his son, lost and gone these years, </p>

<p>for his wife so fine, so wise &mdash; Aerdeath is the worst blow </p>

<p>he's had to suffer &mdash; it made him old before his time. </p>

<p>She died of grief for her boy, her glorious boy, </p>

<p>it wore her down, a wretched way to go. </p>

<p>1 pray that no one 1 love dies such a death, </p>

<p>no island neighbor of mine who treats me kindly! </p>

<p>While she was still alive, heartsick as she was. </p>

<p></p>

<p>it always moved me to ask about her, learn the news. </p>

<p>She'd reared me herself, and right beside her daughter, </p>

<p>Ctimene, graceful girl with her long light gown, </p>

<p>the youngest one she'd borne ... </p>

<p>Just the two of us, growing up together, </p>

<p>the woman tending me almost like her child, </p>

<p>till we both reached the lovely flush of youth </p>

<p>and then her parents gave her away in marriage, yes, </p>

<p>to a Samian man, and a haul of gifts they got. </p>

<p>But her mother decked me out in cloak and shirt, </p>

<p>good clothing she wrapped about me &mdash; gave me sandals, </p>

<p>sent me here, this farm. She loved me from the heart. </p>

<p>Oh how 1 miss her kindness now! The happy gods </p>

<p>speed the work that 1 labor at, that gives me </p>

<p>food and drink to spare for the ones 1 value. </p>

<p>But from Queen Penelope 1 never get a thing, </p>

<p>never a winning word, no friendly gesture, </p>

<p>not since this, this plague has hit the house &mdash; </p>

<p>these high and mighty suitors. Servants miss it, </p>

<p>terribly, gossiping back and forth with the mistress, </p>

<p>gathering scraps of news, a snack and a cup or two, </p>

<p>then taking home to the fields some little gift. </p>

<p>It never fails to cheer a servant's heart.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Imagine that,&quot; his canny master said,  &quot;you must have been just a little fellow, Eumaeus,  when you were swept so far from home and parents.  Come, tell me the whole story, truly too.  Was your city sacked? &mdash;  some city filled with people and wide streets  where your father and your mother made their home?  Or were you all alone, herding your sheep and cattle,  when pirates kidnapped, shipped and sold you off  to this man's house, who paid a healthy price?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;My friend,&quot; the swineherd answered, foreman of men,  &quot;you really want my story? So many questions &mdash; ^well,  listen in quiet, then, and take your ease, sit back </p>

<p></p>

<p>and drink your wine. The nights are endless now. </p>

<p>We've plenty of time to sleep or savor a long tale. </p>

<p>No need, you know, to turn in before the hour. </p>

<p>Even too much sleep can be a bore. </p>

<p>But anyone else who feels the urge </p>

<p>can go to bed and then, at the crack of dawn, </p>

<p>break bread, turn out and tend our master's pigs. </p>

<p>We two will keep to the shelter here, eat and drink </p>

<p>and take some joy in each other 's heartbreaking sorrows, </p>

<p>sharing each other's memories. Over the years, you know, </p>

<p>a man finds solace even in old sorrows, true, a man </p>

<p>who's weathered many blows and wandered many miles. </p>

<p>My own story? This will answer all your questions ... </p>

<p>There's an island, Sy rie &mdash; you may have heard of it &mdash;  off above Ortygia, where the sun wheels around.  Not so packed with people, still a good place, though,  fine for sheep and cattle, rich in wine and wheat.  Hunger never attacks the land, no sickness either,  that always stalks the lives of us poor men.  No, as each generation grows old on the island,  down Apollo comes with his silver bow, with Artemis,  and they shoot them all to death with gentle arrows.  Two cities there are, that split the land in half,  and over them both my father ruled in force &mdash;  Or menus' son Ctesius, a man like a deathless god. </p>

<p>One day </p>

<p>a band of Phoenicians landed there. The famous sea-dogs, </p>

<p>sharp bargainers too, the holds of their black ship </p>

<p>brimful with a hoard of flashy baubles. Now, </p>

<p>my father kept a Phoenician woman in his house, </p>

<p>beautiful, tall and skilled at weaving lovely things, </p>

<p>and her rascal countrymen lusted to seduce her, yes, </p>

<p>and lost no time &mdash; she was washing clothes when one of them </p>

<p>waylaid her beside their ship, in a long deep embrace </p>

<p>that can break a woman's will, even the best alive. </p>

<p>And then he asked her questions ... </p>

<p>her name, who was she, where did she come from? </p>

<p></p>

<p>She waved at once to my father's high-roofed house &mdash;  'But I'm proud to hail from Sidon paved in bronze,' she said,  'and Ary has was my father, a man who rolled in wealth.  I was heading home from the fields when Taphian pirates  snatched me away, and they shipped and sold me here  to this man's house. He paid a good stiff price!' </p>

<p>The sailor, her secret lover, lured her on:  'Well then, why don't you sail back home with us? &mdash;  see your own high house, your father and mother there.  They're still alive, and people say they're rich!' </p>

<p>'Now there's a tempting offer,' she said in haste,  'if only you sailors here would swear an oath  you'll land me safe at home without a scratch.' </p>

<p>Those were her terms, and once they vowed to keep them,  swore their oaths they'd never do her harm,  the woman hatched a plan: 'Now mum's the word!  Let none of your shipmates say a thing to me,  meeting me on the street or at the springs.  Someone might go running off to the house  and tell the old king &mdash; he'd think the worst,  clap me in cruel chains and find a way to kill you.  So keep it a secret, down deep, get on with buying  your home cargo, quickly. But once your holds  are loaded up with goods, then fast as you can  you send the word to me over there at the palace.  I'll bring you all the gold 1 can lay my hands on,  and something else I'll give you in the bargain,  fare for passage home ... </p>

<p>I'm nurse to my master's son in the palace now &mdash;  such a precious toddler, scampering round outside,  always at my heels. I'll bring him aboard as well.  Wherever you sell him off, whatever foreign parts,  he'll fetch you quite a price!' </p>

<p>Bargain struck,  back the woman went to our lofty halls </p>

<p></p>

<p>and the rovers stayed on with us one whole year,  bartering, piling up big hoards in their hollow ship,  and once their holds were loaded full for sailing  they sent a messenger, fast, to alert the woman.  This crafty bandit came to my father's house,  dangling a golden choker linked with amber beads,  and while the maids at hall and my noble mother  kept on fondling it &mdash; dazzled, feasting their eyes  and making bids &mdash; he gave a quiet nod to my nurse,  he gave her the nod and slunk back to his ship.  Grabbing my hand, she swept me through the house  and there in the porch she came on cups and tables  left by the latest f casters, father's men of council  just gone off to the meeting grounds for full debate &mdash;  and quick as a flash she snatched up three goblets,  tucked them into her bosom, whisked them off  and 1 tagged along, lost in all my innocence!  The sun sank, the roads of the world grew dark  and both on the run, we reached the bay at once  where the swift Phoenician ship lay set to sail.  Handing us up on board, the crewmen launched out  on the foaming lanes and Zeus sent wind astern.  Six whole days we sailed, six nights, nonstop,  and then, when the god brought on the seventh day,  Artemis showering arrows came and shot the woman &mdash;  headfirst into the bilge she splashed like a diving tern  and the crewmen heaved her body over, a nice treat  for the seals and fish, but left me all alone,  cowering, sick at heart ... </p>

<p>Until, at last,  the wind and current bore us on to Ithaca,  here where Laertes bought me with his wealth.  And so 1 first laid eyes on this good land.&quot; </p>

<p>And royal King Odysseus answered warmly,  &quot;Eumaeus, so much misery! You've moved my heart,  deeply, with your long tale &mdash; such pain, such sorrow.  True, but look at the good fortune Zeus sends you. </p>

<p></p>

<p>hand-in-hand with the bad. After all your toil </p>

<p>you reached the house of a decent, kindly man </p>

<p>who gives you all you need in meat and drink &mdash; </p>

<p>he's seen to that, I'd say &mdash; </p>

<p>it's a fine life you lead! Better than mine ... </p>

<p>I've been drifting through cities up and down the earth </p>

<p>and now I've landed here.&quot; </p>

<p>So guest and host  confided through the night until they slept,  a little at least, not long.  Dawn soon rose and took her golden throne. </p>

<p>That hour </p>

<p>Telemachus and his shipmates raised the coasts of home, </p>

<p>they struck sail and lowered the mast, smartly, </p>

<p>rowed her into a mooring under oars. </p>

<p>Out went the bow-stones, cables fast astern, </p>

<p>the crew themselves swung out in the breaking surf, </p>

<p>they got a meal together and mixed some ruddy wine. </p>

<p>And once they 'd put aside desire for food and drink, </p>

<p>clear-headed Telemachus gave the men commands: </p>

<p>&quot;Pull our black ship round to the city now &mdash; </p>

<p>I'm off to my herdsmen and my farms. By nightfall, </p>

<p>once I've seen to my holdings, I'll be down in town. </p>

<p>In the morning I'll give you wages for the voyage, </p>

<p>a handsome feast of meat and hearty wine.&quot; </p>

<p>The seer Theocly menus broke in quickly,  &quot;Where shall 1 go, dear boy? Of all the lords  in rocky Ithaca, whose house shall 1 head for now?  Or do 1 go straight to your mother's house and yours?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Surely in better times,&quot; discreet Telemachus replied,  &quot;1 would invite you home. Our hospitality never fails,  but now, 1 fear, it could only serve you poorly.  I'll be away, and mother would never see you.  She rarely appears these days,  what with those suitors milling in the hall;  she keeps to her upper story, weaving at her loom. </p>

<p></p>

<p>But I'll mention someone else you might just visit:  Eurymachus, wise Polybus' fine, upstanding son.  He's the man of the hour! Our island people  look on him like a god &mdash; the prince of suitors,  hottest to wed my mother, seize my father's powers.  But god knows &mdash; Zeus up there in his bright Olympus &mdash;  whether or not before that wedding day arrives  he'll bring the day of death on all their heads! ' </p>

<p>At his last words a bird flew past on the right,  a hawk, Apollo's wind-swift herald &mdash; tight in his claws  a struggling dove, and he ripped its feathers out  and they drifted down to earth between the ship  and the young prince himself ...  The prophet called him aside, clear of his men,  and grasped his hand, exclaiming, &quot;Look, Telemachus,  the will of god just winged that bird on your right!  Why, the moment 1 saw it, here before my eyes,  1 knew it was a sign. No line more kingly than yours  in all of Ithaca &mdash; yours^Ni\\ reign forever!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;If only, friend,&quot;  alert Telemachus answered, &quot;all you say comes true!  You'd soon know my affection, know my gifts.  Any man you meet would call you blest.&quot; </p>

<p>He turned to a trusted friend and said, &quot;Piraeus,  son of Clytius, you are the one who's done my bidding,  more than all other friends who sailed with me to Pylos.  Please, take this guest of mine to your own house,  treat him kindly, host him with all good will  till 1 can come myself.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Of course, Telemachus,&quot;  Piraeus the gallant spearman offered warmly:  &quot;Stay up-country just as long as you like.  I'll tend the man, he'll never lack a lodging. &quot; </p>

<p>Piraeus boarded ship and told the crew  to embark at once and cast off cables quickly &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>they swung aboard and sat to the oars in ranks. </p>

<p>Telemachus fastened rawhide sandals on his feet </p>

<p>and took from the decks his rugged bronze-tipped spear. </p>

<p>The men cast off, pushed out and pulled for town </p>

<p>as Telemachus ordered, King Odysseus' son. </p>

<p>The prince strode out briskly, </p>

<p>legs speeding him on till he reached the farm </p>

<p>where his great droves of pigs crowded their pens </p>

<p>and the loyal swineherd often slept beside them, </p>

<p>always the man to serve his masters well. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Book XVI </p>

<p></p>

<p>Father and Son </p>

<p></p>

<p>As dawn came into the lodge, the king and loyal swineherd  set out breakfast, once they had raked the fire up  and got the herdsmen off with droves of pigs.  And now Telemachus ... </p>

<p>the howling dogs went nuzzling up around him,  not a growl as he approached. From inside  Odysseus noticed the pack's quiet welcome,  noticed the light tread of footsteps too  and turned to Eumaeus quickly, winged a word:  &quot;Eumaeus, here comes a friend of yours, I'd say.  Someone you know, at least. The pack's not barking,  must be fawning around him. 1 can hear his footfall.&quot; </p>

<p>The words were still on his lips when his own son  stood in the doorway, there. The swineherd started up. </p>

<p></p>

<p>amazed, he dropped the bowls with a clatter &mdash; he'd been busy </p>

<p>mixing ruddy wine. Straight to the prince he rushed </p>

<p>and kissed his face and kissed his shining eyes, </p>

<p>both hands, as the tears rolled down his cheeks. </p>

<p>As a father, brimming with love, welcomes home </p>

<p>his darling only son in a warm embrace &mdash; </p>

<p>what pain he's borne for him and him alone! &mdash; </p>

<p>home now, in the tenth year from far abroad, </p>

<p>so the loyal swineherd hugged the beaming prince, </p>

<p>he clung for dear life, covering him with kisses, yes, </p>

<p>like one escaped from death. Eumaeus wept and sobbed, </p>

<p>his words flew from the heart: &quot;You're home, Telemachus, </p>

<p>sweet light of my eyes! 1 never thought I'd see you again, </p>

<p>once you'd shipped to Pylos! Quick, dear boy, come in, </p>

<p>let me look at you, look to my heart's content &mdash; </p>

<p>under my own roof, the rover home at last. </p>

<p>You rarely visit the farm and men these days, </p>

<p>always keeping to town, as if it cheered ^ou </p>

<p>to see them there, that infernal crowd of suitors! &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Have it your way,&quot; thoughtful Telemachus replied.  &quot;Dear old man, it's all for youXhaA. I've come,  to see you for myself and learn the news &mdash;  whether mother still holds out in the halls  or some other man has married her at last,  and Odysseus' bed, 1 suppose, is lying empty,  blanketed now with filthy cobwebs.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Surely,&quot; </p>

<p>the foreman of men responded, &quot;she's still waiting  there in your halls, poor woman, suffering so,  her life an endless hardship ...  wasting away the nights, weeping away the days.&quot; </p>

<p>With that </p>

<p>he took the bronze spear from the boy, and Telemachus,  crossing the stone doorsill, went inside the lodge.  As he approached, his father, Odysseus, rose  to yield his seat, but the son on his part  waved him back: &quot;Stay where you are, stranger. </p>

<p></p>

<p>I know we can find another seat somewhere,  here on our farm, and here's the man to fetch it.&quot; </p>

<p>So Odysseus, moving back, sat down once more,  and now for the prince the swineherd strewed a bundle  of fresh green brushwood, topped it off with sheepskin  and there the true son of Odysseus took his place.  Eumaeus set before them platters of roast meat,  left from the meal he'd had the day before;  he promptly served them bread, heaped in baskets,  mixed their hearty wine in a wooden bowl  and then sat down himself to face the king.  They reached for the good things that lay at hand,  and when they 'd put aside desire for food and drink  Telemachus asked his loyal serving-man at last,  &quot;Old friend, where does this stranger come from?  Why did the sailors land him here in Ithaca?  Who did they say they are?  1 hardly think he came this way on foot.&quot; </p>

<p>You answered him, Eumaeus, loyal swineherd,  &quot;Here, my boy, I'll tell you the whole true story.  He hails from Crete's broad land, he's proud to say,  but he claims he's drifted round through countless towns of  roaming the earth ... so a god's spun out his fate.  He just now broke away from some Thesprotian ship  and came to my farm. I'll put him in yourhands,  you tend to him as you like.  He counts on you, he says, for care and shelter.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Shelter? Oh Eumaeus,&quot; Telemachus replied,  &quot;that word of yours, it cuts me to the quick!  How can 1 lend the stranger refuge in my house?  I'm young myself. 1 can hardly trust my hands  to fight off any man who rises up against me.  Then my mother's wavering, always torn two ways:  whether to stay with me and care for the household,  true to her husband's bed, the people's voice as well. </p>

<p></p>

<p>or leave at long last with the best man in Achaea </p>

<p>who courts her in the halls, who offers her the most. </p>

<p>But our new guest, since he's arrived at your house, </p>

<p>I'll give him a shirt and cloak to wear, good clothing, </p>

<p>give him a two-edged sword and sandals for his feet </p>

<p>and send him off, wherever his heart desires. </p>

<p>Or if you'd rather, keep him here at the farmstead, </p>

<p>tend to him here, and I'll send up the clothes </p>

<p>and full rations to keep the man in food; </p>

<p>he'll be no drain on you and all your men. </p>

<p>But 1 can't let him go down and join the suitors. </p>

<p>They're far too abusive, reckless, know no limits: </p>

<p>they 'll make a mockery of him &mdash; that would break my heart. </p>

<p>It's hard for a man to win his way against a mob, </p>

<p>even a man of iron. They are much too strong. &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Friend &quot; &mdash; the long-enduring Odysseus stepped in &mdash;  &quot;surely it's right for me to say a word at this point.  My heart, by god, is torn to pieces hearing this,  both of you telling how these reckless suitors,  there in your own house, against your will,  plot your ruin &mdash; a fine young prince like you.  Tell me, though, do you /e/^yourself be so abused  or do people round about, stirred up by the prompting  of some god, despise you? Or are your brothers at fault?  Brothers a man can trust to fight beside him, true,  no matter what deadly blood-feud rages on.  Would 1 were young as you, to match my spirit now,  or 1 were the son of great Odysseus, or the king himself  returned from all his roving &mdash; ^there's still room for hope!  Then let some foreigner lop my head off if 1 failed  to march right into Odysseus' royal halls  and kill them all. And what if 1 went down,  crushed by their numbers &mdash; 1, fighting alone?  I'd rather die, cut down in my own house  than have to look on at their outrage day by day.  Guests treated to blows, men dragging the serving-women  through the noble house, exploiting them all, no shame. </p>

<p></p>

<p>and the gushing wine swilled, the food squandered &mdash; </p>

<p>gorging for gorging's sake &mdash; </p>

<p>and the courting game goes on, no end in sight! &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You're right, my friend, &quot; sober Telemachus agreed.  &quot;Now let me tell you the whole story, first to last.  It's not that allom people have turned against me,  keen for a showdown. Nor have 1 any brothers at fault,  brothers a man can trust to fight beside him, true,  no matter what deadly blood-feud rages on ...  Zeus made our line a line of only sons.  Arcesius had only one son, Laertes,  and Laertes had only one son, Odysseus,  and 1 am Odysseus' only son. He fathered me,  he left me behind at home, and from me he got no joy.  So now our house is plagued by swarms of enemies.  All the nobles who rule the islands round about,  Dulichion, and Same, and wooded Zacynthus too,  and all who lord it in rocky Ithaca as well &mdash;  down to the last man they court my mother,  they lay waste my house! And mother ...  she neither rejects a marriage she despises  nor can she bear to bring the courting to an end &mdash;  while they continue to bleed my household white.  Soon &mdash; you wait &mdash; ^they'll grind /nedown as well!  But all lies in the lap of the great gods. </p>

<p>Eumaeus, </p>

<p>good old friend, go, quickly, to wise Penelope.  Tell her I'm home from Pylos safe and sound.  I'll stay on right here. But you come back  as soon as you've told the news to her alone.  No other Achaean must hear &mdash;  all too many plot to take my life.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Iknow,&quot; </p>

<p>you assured your prince, Eumaeus, loyal swineherd.  &quot;1 see your point &mdash; ^there's sense in this old head.  One thing more, and make your orders clear. </p>

<p></p>

<p>On the same trip do I go and give the news </p>

<p>to King Laertes too? For many years, poor man, </p>

<p>heartsick for his son, he'd always keep an eye </p>

<p>on the farm and take his meals with the hired hands </p>

<p>whenever he felt the urge to. Now, from the day </p>

<p>you sailed away to Pylos, not a sip or a bite </p>

<p>he's touched, they say, not as he did before, </p>

<p>and his eyes are shut to all the farmyard labors. </p>

<p>Huddled over, groaning in grief and tears, </p>

<p>he wastes away &mdash; the man's all skin and bones. ' </p>

<p>&quot;So much the worse, ' Telemachus answered firmly.  &quot;Leave him alone; though it hurts us now, we must.  If men could have all they want, free for the taking,  /(c/take first my father's journey home. So,  you go and give the message, then come back,  no roaming over the fields to find Laertes.  Tell my mother to send her housekeeper,  fast as she can, in secret &mdash;  she can give the poor old man the news.&quot; </p>

<p>That roused Eumaeus. The swineherd grasped his sandals,  strapped them onto his feet and made for town.  His exit did not escape Athena's notice ...  Approaching, closer, now she appeared a woman,  beautiful, tall and skilled at weaving lovely things.  Just at the shelter's door she stopped, visible to Odysseus  but Telemachus could not see her, sense her there &mdash;  the gods don't show themselves to every man alive.  Odysseus saw her, so did the dogs; no barking now,  they whimpered, cringing away in terror through the yard.  She gave a sign with her brows, Odysseus caught it,  out of the lodge he went and past the high stockade  and stood before the goddess. Athena urged him on:  &quot;Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, old campaigner,  now is the time, now tell your son the truth.  Hold nothing back, so the two of you can plot </p>

<p></p>

<p>the suitors' doom and then set out for town.  I myself won't lag behind you long &mdash;  I'm blazing for a battle!&quot; </p>

<p>Athena stroked him with her golden wand.  First she made the cloak and shirt on his body  fresh and clean, then made him taller, supple, young,  his ruddy tan came back, the cut of his jawline firmed  and the dark beard clustered black around his chin.  Her work complete, she went her way once more  and Odysseus returned to the lodge. His own son  gazed at him, wonderstruck, terrified too, turning  his eyes away, suddenly &mdash; </p>

<p>this must be some god &mdash;  and he let fly with a burst of exclamations:  &quot;Friend, you're a new man &mdash; not what 1 saw before!  Your clothes, they've changed, even your skin has changed &mdash;  surely you are some god who rules the vaulting skies!  Oh be kind, and we will give you offerings,  gifts of hammered gold to warm your heart &mdash;  spare us, please, 1 beg you!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No, lam not a god,&quot;  the long-enduring, great Odysseus returned.  &quot;Why confuse me with one who never dies?  No, 1 am your father &mdash;  the Odysseus you wept for all your days,  you bore a world of pain, the cruel abuse of men.&quot; </p>

<p>And with those words Odysseus kissed his son  and the tears streamed down his cheeks and wet the ground,  though before he'd always reined his emotions back.  But still not convinced that it was his father,  Telemachus broke out, wild with disbelief,  &quot;No, you're not Odysseus! Not my father!  Just some spirit spellbinding me now &mdash;  to make me ache with sorrow all the more.  Impossible for a mortal to work such marvels,  not with his own devices, not unless some god </p>

<p></p>

<p>comes down in person, eager to make that mortal  young or old &mdash; like that! Why, just now  you were old, and wrapped in rags, but now, look,  you seem like a god who rules the skies up there!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Telemachus, &quot; Odysseus, man of exploits, urged his son,  &quot;it's wrong to marvel, carried away in wonder so  at sight of your father here before your eyes.  No other Odysseus will ever return to you.  That man and 1 are one, the man you see ...  here after many hardships,  endless wanderings, after twenty years  1 have come home to native ground at last.  My changing so? Athena's work, the Fighter 's Queen &mdash;  she has that power, she makes me look as she likes,  now like a beggar, the next moment a young man,  decked out in handsome clothes about my body.  It's light work for the gods who rule the skies  to exalt a mortal man or bring him low. &quot; </p>

<p>At that </p>

<p>Odysseus sat down again, and Telemachus threw his arms  around his great father, sobbing uncontrollably  as the deep desire for tears welled up in both.  They cried out, shrilling cries, pulsing sharper  than birds of prey &mdash; eagles, vultures with hooked claws &mdash;  when farmers plunder their nest of young too young to fly.  Both men so filled with compassion, eyes streaming tears,  that now the sunlight would have set upon their cries  if Telemachus had not asked his father, all at once,  &quot;What sort of ship, dear father, brought you here? &mdash;  Ithaca, at last. Who did the sailors say they are?  1 hardly think you came back home on foot!&quot; </p>

<p>So long an exile, great Odysseus replied,  &quot;Surely, my son, I'll tell you the whole story now.  Phaeacians brought me here, the famous sailors  who ferry home all men who reach their shores.  They sailed me across the sea in their swift ship. </p>

<p></p>

<p>they set me down in Ithaca, sound asleep, and gave me  glittering gifts &mdash; bronze and hoards of gold and robes.  All lie stowed in a cave, thanks to the gods' help,  and Athena's inspiration spurred me here, now,  so we could plan the slaughter of our foes.  Come, give me the full tally of these suitors &mdash;  1 must see their numbers, gauge their strength.  Then I'll deploy this old tactician's wits,  decide if the two of us can take them on,  alone, without allies, </p>

<p>or we should hunt reserves to back us up.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Father,&quot; </p>

<p>clear-headed Telemachus countered quickly, </p>

<p>&quot;all my life I've heard of your great fame &mdash; </p>

<p>a brave man in war and a deep mind in counsel &mdash; </p>

<p>but what you say dumbfounds me, staggers imagination! </p>

<p>How on earth could two men fight so many and so strong? </p>

<p>These suitors are not just ten or twenty, they're far more &mdash; </p>

<p>you count them up for yourself now, take a moment ... </p>

<p>From Dulichion, fifty -two of them, picked young men, </p>

<p>six servants in their troop; from Same, twenty-four, </p>

<p>from Zacynthus, twenty Achaeans, nobles all, </p>

<p>and the twelve best lords from Ithaca itself. </p>

<p>Medon the herald's with them, a gifted bard, </p>

<p>and two henchmen, skilled to carve their meat. </p>

<p>If we pit ourselves against all these in the house, </p>

<p>1 fear the revenge you come back home to take </p>

<p>will recoil on our heads &mdash; a bitter, deadly blow. </p>

<p>Think: can you come up with a friend-in-arms? </p>

<p>Some man to fight beside us, some brave heart?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Let me tell you,&quot; the old soldier said,  &quot;bear it in mind now, listen to me closely.  Think:^N\\\ Athena flanked by Father Zeus  do for the two of us? </p>

<p>Or shall 1 rack my brains for another champion?&quot;  Telemachus answered shrewdly, full of poise. </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Two great champions, those you name, it's true. </p>

<p>Off in the clouds they sit </p>

<p>and they lord it over gods and mortal men. &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Trust me, &quot; his seasoned father reassured him,  &quot; tIley^Non't hold off long from the cries and clash of battle,  not when we and the suitors put our fighting strength  to proof in my own halls! But now, with daybreak,  home you go and mix with that overbearing crowd.  The swineherd will lead me into the city later,  looking old and broken, a beggar once again.  If they abuse me in the palace, steel yourself,  no matter what outrage 1 must suffer, even  if they drag me through our house by the heels  and throw me out or pelt me with things they hurl &mdash;  you just look on, endure it. Prompt them to quit  their wild reckless ways, try to win them over  with friendly words. Those men will never listen,  now the day of doom is hovering at their heads.  One more thing. Take it to heart, 1 urge you.  When Athena, Queen of Tactics, tells me it is time,  I'll give you a nod, and when you catch that signal  round up all the deadly weapons kept in the hall,  stow them away upstairs in a storeroom's deep recess &mdash;  all the arms and armor &mdash; and when the suitors miss them  and ask you questions, put them off with a winning story:  '1 stowed them away, clear of the smoke. A far cry  from the arms Odysseus left when he went to Troy,  fire-damaged equipment, black with reeking fumes.  And a god reminded me of something darker too.  When you're in your cups a quarrel might break out,  you'd wound each other, shame your feasting here  and cast a pall on your courting.  Iron has powers to draw a man to ruin.' </p>

<p>Just you leave  a pair of swords for the two of us, a pair of spears  and a pair of oxhide bucklers right at hand so we  can break for the weapons, seize them! Then Athena, </p>

<p></p>

<p>Zeus in his wisdom &mdash; they will daze the suitors' wits.  Now one last thing. Bear it in mind. You must.  If you are my own true son, born of my blood,  let no one hear that Odysseus has come home.  Don't let Laertes know, not Eumaeus either,  none in the household, not Penelope herself.  You and 1 alone will assess the women's mood  and we might test a few of the serving-men as well:  where are the ones who still respect us both,  who hold us in awe? And who shirk their duties? &mdash;  slighting you because you are so young.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Soon enough, father, &quot; his gallant son replied,  &quot;you'll sense the courage inside me, that 1 know &mdash;  I'm hardly a flighty, weak-willed boy these days.  But 1 think your last plan would gain us nothing.  Reconsider, 1 urge you. </p>

<p>You'll waste time, roaming around our holdings, </p>

<p>probing the fieldhands man by man, while the suitors </p>

<p>sit at ease in our house, devouring all our goods &mdash; </p>

<p>those brazen rascals never spare a scrap! </p>

<p>But 1 do advise you to sound the women out: </p>

<p>who are disloyal to you, who are guiltless? </p>

<p>The men &mdash; 1 say no to testing them farm by farm. </p>

<p>That's work for later, if you have really seen </p>

<p>a sign from Zeus whose shield is storm and thunder. &quot; </p>

<p>Now as father and son conspired, shaping plans,  the ship that brought the prince and shipmates back  from Pylos was just approaching Ithaca, home port.  As soon as they put in to the harbor's deep bay  they hauled the black vessel up onto dry land  and eager deckhands bore away their gear  and rushed the priceless gifts to Clytius' house.  But they sent a herald on to Odysseus' halls at once  to give the news to thoughtful, cautious Penelope  that Telemachus was home&mdash; just up-country now,  but he'd told his mates to sail across to port &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>so the noble queen would not be seized with fright  and break down in tears. And now those two men met,  herald and swineherd, both out on the same errand,  to give the queen the news. But once they reached  the house of the royal king the herald strode up,  into the serving-women's midst, and burst out,  &quot;Your beloved son, my queen, is home at last!&quot;  Eumaeus though, bending close to Penelope,  whispered every word that her dear son  entrusted him to say. Message told in full,  he left the halls and precincts, heading for his pigs. </p>

<p>But the news shook the suitors, dashed their spirits.  Out of the halls they crowded, past the high-walled court  and there before the gates they sat in council.  Poly bus' son Eurymachus opened up among them:  &quot;Friends, what a fine piece of work he's carried off!  Telemachus &mdash; what insolence &mdash; and we thought his little jaunt  would come to grief! Up now, launch a black ship,  the best we can find &mdash; muster a crew of oarsmen,  row the news to our friends in ambush, fast,  bring them back at once. &quot; </p>

<p>And just then &mdash;  he'd not quite finished when Amphinomus,  wheeling round in his seat,  saw their vessel moored in the deep harbor,  their comrades striking sail and hoisting oars.  He broke into heady laughter, called his friends:  &quot;No need for a message now. They're home, look there!  Some god gave them the news, or they saw the prince's ship  go sailing past and failed to overtake her.&quot; </p>

<p>Rising, all trooped down to the water's edge  as the crew hauled the vessel up onto dry land  and the hot-blooded hands bore off their gear.  Then in a pack they went to the meeting grounds,  suffering no one else, young or old, to sit among them.  Eupithes' son Antinous rose and harangued them all: </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;What a blow! See how the gods have saved this boy </p>

<p>from bloody death? And our lookouts all day long, </p>

<p>stationed atop the windy heights, kept watch, </p>

<p>shift on shift; and once the sun went down </p>

<p>we'd never sleep the night ashore, never, </p>

<p>always aboard our swift ship, cruising till dawn, </p>

<p>patrolling to catch Telemachus, kill him on the spot, </p>

<p>and all the while some spirit whisked him home! </p>

<p>So here at home^Ne'\\ plot his certain death: </p>

<p>he must never slip through our hands again, </p>

<p>that boy &mdash; while he still lives, </p>

<p>1 swear we'll never bring our venture off. </p>

<p>The clever little schemer, he does have his skills, </p>

<p>and the crowds no longer show us favor, not at all. </p>

<p>So act! before he can gather his people in assembly. </p>

<p>He'll never give in an inch, 1 know, he'll rise </p>

<p>and rage away, shouting out to them all how we, </p>

<p>we schemed his sudden death but never caught him. </p>

<p>Hearing of our foul play, they'll hardly sing our praises. </p>

<p>Why, they might do us damage, run us off our lands, </p>

<p>drive us abroad to hunt for strangers' shores. </p>

<p>Strike first, 1 say, and kill him! &mdash; </p>

<p>clear of town, in the fields or on the road. </p>

<p>Then we'll seize his estates and worldly goods, </p>

<p>carve them up between us, share and share alike. </p>

<p>But as for his palace, let his mother keep it, </p>

<p>she and the man she weds. </p>

<p>There's my plan.  If you find it offensive, if you want him  living on &mdash; in full command of his patrimony &mdash;  gather here no more then, living the life of kings,  consuming all his wealth. Each from his own house  must try to win her, showering her with gifts-  Then she can marry the one who offers most,  the man marked out by fate to be her husband.&quot; </p>

<p>That brought them all to a hushed, stunned silence  till Amphinomus rose to have his say among them &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>the noted son of Nisus, King Aretias' grandson,  the chief who led the suitors from DuUchion,  land of grass and grains,  and the man who pleased Penelope the most,  thanks to his timely words and good clear sense.  Concerned for their welfare now, he stood and argued:  &quot;Friends, I've no desire to kill Telemachus, not 1 &mdash;  it's a terrible thing to shed the blood of kings.  Wait, sound out the will of the gods &mdash; that first.  If the decrees of mighty Zeus commend the work,  I'll kill the prince myself and spur on all the rest.  If the gods are against it, then 1 say hold back!&quot; </p>

<p>So Amphinomus urged, and won them over.  They rose at once, returned to Odysseus' palace,  entered and took their seats on burnished chairs. </p>

<p>But now an inspiration took the discreet Penelope  to face her suitors, brutal, reckless men.  The queen had heard it all ...  how they plotted inside the house to kill her son.  The herald Medon told her &mdash; he'd overheard their schemes.  And so, flanked by her ladies, she descended to the hall.  That luster of women, once she reached her suitors,  drawing her glistening veil across her cheeks,  paused now where a column propped the sturdy roof  and wheeling on Antinous, cried out against him:  &quot;You, Antinous! Violent, vicious, scheming &mdash;  you, they say, are the best man your age in Ithaca,  best for eloquence, counsel. You're nothing of the sort!  Madman, why do you weave destruction for Telemachus? &mdash;  show no pity to those who need it? &mdash; ^those over whom  almighty Zeus stands guard. It's wrong, unholy, yes,  weaving death for those who deserve your mercy!  Don't you know how your fatAerfied here once?  A fugitive, terrified of the people, up in arms  against him because he'd joined some Taphian pirates  out to attack Thesprotians, sworn allies of ours. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The mobs were set to destroy him, rip his hfe out, </p>

<p>devour his vast wealth to their heart's content, </p>

<p>but Odysseus held them back, he kept their fury down. </p>

<p>And thisis the man whose house you waste, scot-free, </p>

<p>whose wife you court, whose son you mean to kill &mdash; </p>

<p>you make my life an agony! Stop, 1 tell you, </p>

<p>stop all this, and make the rest stop too!&quot; </p>

<p>But Polybus' son Eurymachus tried to calm her:  &quot;Wise Penelope, daughter of Icarius, courage!  Disabuse yourself of all these worries now.  That man is not alive &mdash;  he never will be, he never can be born &mdash;  who'll lift a hand against Telemachus, your son,  not while /walk the land and 1 can see the light.  1 tell you this &mdash; so help me, it will all come true &mdash;  in an instant that man's blood will spurt around my spear!  Mz/ spear, since time and again Odysseus dandled me  on his knees, the great raider of cities fed me  roasted meat and held the red wine to my lips.  So to /neyour son is the dearest man alive,  and 1 urge the boy to have no fear of death,  not from the suitors at least. </p>

<p>What comes from the gods &mdash; ^there's no escaping that.&quot; </p>

<p>Encouraging, all the way, but all the while  plotting the prince's murder in his mind ...  The queen, going up to her lofty well-lit room,  fell to weeping for Odysseus, her beloved husband,  till watchful Athena sealed her eyes with welcome sleep. </p>

<p>Returning just at dusk to Odysseus and his son,  the loyal swineherd found they'd killed a yearling pig  and standing over it now were busy fixing supper.  But Athena had approached Laertes' son Odysseus,  tapped him with her wand and made him old again.  She dressed him in filthy rags too, for fear Eumaeus,  recognizing his master face-to-face, might hurry </p>

<p></p>

<p>back to shrewd Penelope, blurting out the news  and never hide the secret in his heart. </p>

<p>Telemachus was the first to greet the swineherd:  &quot;Welcome home, my friend! What's the talk in town?  Are the swaggering suitors back from ambush yet &mdash;  or still waiting to catch me coming home?&quot; </p>

<p>You answered the prince, Eumaeus, loyal swineherd,  &quot;1 had no time to go roaming all through town,  digging round for that. My heart raced me on  to get my message told and rush back here.  But 1 met up with a fast runner there,  sent by your crew, a herald,  first to tell your mother all the news.  And this 1 know, 1 saw with my own eyes &mdash;  1 was just above the city, heading home,  clambering over Hermes' Ridge, when 1 caught sight  of a trim ship pulling into the harbor, loaded down  with a crowd aboard her, shields and two-edged spears.  1 thinkXhe^'TQ the men you're after &mdash; I'm not sure.&quot; </p>

<p>At that the young prince Telemachus smiled,  glancing toward his father, avoiding Eumaeus' eyes. </p>

<p>And now, </p>

<p>with the roasting done, the meal set out, they ate well  and no one's hunger lacked a proper share of supper.  When they'd put aside desire for food and drink,  they remembered bed and took the gift of sleep. </p>

<p>Book XVII </p>

<p></p>

<p>Stranger at  the Gates </p>

<p>when young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more </p>

<p>Telemachus strapped his rawhide sandals to his feet </p>

<p>and the young prince, the son of King Odysseus, </p>

<p>picked up the rugged spear that fit his grip </p>

<p>and striking out for the city, told his swineherd, </p>

<p>&quot;I'm off to town, old friend, to present myself to mother. </p>

<p>She'll never stop her bitter tears and mourning, </p>

<p>well 1 know, till she sees me face-to-face. </p>

<p>And for you 1 have some orders &mdash; </p>

<p>take this luckless stranger to town, so he can beg </p>

<p>his supper there, and whoever wants can give the man </p>

<p>some crumbs and a cup to drink. How can /put up with </p>

<p>every passerby? My mind's weighed down with troubles. </p>

<p>If the stranger resents it, all the worse for him. </p>

<p>1 like to tell the truth and tell it straight.&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;My friend, </p>

<p>subtle Odysseus broke in, &quot;I've no desire, myself, </p>

<p>to linger here. Better that beggars cadge their meals </p>

<p>in town than in the fields. Some willing soul </p>

<p>will see to my needs. I'm hardly fit, at my age, </p>

<p>to keep to a farm and jump to a foreman's every order. </p>

<p>Go on then. This man will take me, as you've told him, </p>

<p>once I'm warm from the fire and the sun's good and strong. </p>

<p>Look at the clothing on my back &mdash; all rags and tatters. </p>

<p>I'm afraid the frost at dawn could do me in, </p>

<p>and town, you say, is a long hard way from here.&quot; </p>

<p>At that Telemachus strode down through the farm  in quick, firm strides, brooding death for the suitors.  And once he reached his well-constructed palace,  propping his spear against a sturdy pillar  and crossing the stone threshold, in he went. </p>

<p>His old nurse was the first to see him, Eurycleia,  just spreading fleeces over the carved, inlaid chairs.  Tears sprang to her eyes, she rushed straight to the prince  as the other maids of great Odysseus flocked around him,  hugged him warmly, kissed his head and shoulders. </p>

<p>Now down from her chamber came discreet Penelope,  looking for all the world like Artemis or golden Aphrodite &mdash;  bursting into tears as she flung her arms around her darling son  and kissed his face and kissed his shining eyes and sobbed,  &quot;You're home, Telemachus!&quot; &mdash; ^words flew from her heart &mdash;  &quot;sweet light of my eyes! 1 never thought I'd see you again,  once you shipped to Pylos &mdash; against my will, so secret,  out for news of your dear father. Quick tell me,  did you catch sight of the man &mdash; meet him &mdash; ^what?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Please, mother,&quot; steady Telemachus replied,  &quot;don't move me to tears, don't stir the heart inside me.  I've just escaped from death. Sudden death.  No. Bathe now, put on some fresh clothes. </p>

<p></p>

<p>go up to your own room with your serving-women, </p>

<p>pray, and promise the gods a generous sacrifice </p>

<p>to bring success, if Zeus will ever grant us </p>

<p>the hour of our revenge. I myself am off </p>

<p>to the meeting grounds to summon up a guest </p>

<p>who came with me from abroad when 1 sailed home. </p>

<p>1 sent him on ahead with my trusted crew. </p>

<p>1 told Piraeus to take him to his house, </p>

<p>treat him well, host him with all good will </p>

<p>till 1 could come myself.&quot; </p>

<p>Words to the mark  that left his mother silent ...  She bathed now, put on some fresh clothes,  prayed, and promised the gods a generous sacrifice  to bring success, if Zeus would ever grant  the hour of their revenge. </p>

<p>Spear in hand,  Telemachus strode on through the hall and out,  and a pair of sleek hounds went trotting at his heels.  And Athena lavished a marvelous splendor on the prince  so the people all gazed in wonder as he came forward.  The swaggering suitors clustered, milling round him,  welcome words on their lips, and murder in their hearts.  But he gave them a wide berth as they came crowding in  and there where Mentor sat, Antiphus, Halitherses too &mdash;  his father's loyal friends from the early days &mdash;  he took his seat as they pressed him with their questions.  And just then Piraeus the gallant spearman approached,  leading the stranger through the town and out onto  the meeting grounds. Telemachus, not hanging back,  went right up to greet Theoclymenus, his guest,  but Piraeus spoke out first: &quot;Quickly now,  Telemachus, send some women to my house  to retrieve the gifts that Menelaus gave you.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Wait, Piraeus,&quot; wary Telemachus cautioned,  &quot;we've no idea how all of this will go. </p>

<p></p>

<p>If the brazen suitors cut me down in the palace &mdash;  off guard &mdash; and carve apart my father's whole estate,  I'd rather you yourself, or one of his friends here,  keep those gifts and get some pleasure from them.  But if 1 can bring down slaughter on that crew,  you send the gifts to my house &mdash; we'll share the joy.&quot; </p>

<p>Their plans made, he led the wayworn stranger home  and once they reached the well-constructed palace,  spreading out their cloaks on a chair or bench,  into the burnished tubs they climbed and bathed.  When women had washed them, rubbed them down with oil  and drawn warm fleece and shirts around their shoulders,  out of the baths they stepped and sat on high-backed chairs.  A maid brought water soon in a graceful golden pitcher  and over a silver basin tipped it out  so they might rinse their hands,  then pulled a gleaming table to their side.  A staid housekeeper brought on bread to serve them,  appetizers aplenty too, lavish with her bounty.  Penelope sat across from her son, beside a pillar,  leaning back on a low chair and winding finespun yarn.  They reached out for the good things that lay at hand  and when they'd put aside desire for food and drink,  the queen, for all her composure, said at last,  &quot;Telemachus, I'm going back to my room upstairs  and lie down on my bed ...  that bed of pain my tears have streaked, year in,  year out, from the day Odysseus sailed away to Troy  with Atreus' two sons. </p>

<p>But you, you never had the heart &mdash;  before those insolent suitors crowd back to the house &mdash;  to tell me clearly about your father's journey home,  if you've heard any news.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Of course, mother,&quot;  thoughtful Telemachus reassured her quickly,  &quot;1 will tell you the whole true story now. </p>

<p></p>

<p>We sailed to Pylos, to Nestor, the great king, </p>

<p>and he received me there in his lofty palace, </p>

<p>treated me well and warmly, yes, as a father treats </p>

<p>a long-lost son just home from voyaging, years abroad: </p>

<p>such care he showered on me, he and his noble sons. </p>

<p>But of strong, enduring Odysseus, dead or alive, </p>

<p>he's heard no news, he said, from any man on earth. </p>

<p>He sent me on to the famous spearman Atrides Menelaus, </p>

<p>on with a team of horses drawing a bolted chariot. </p>

<p>And there 1 saw her, Helen of Argos &mdash; all for her </p>

<p>Achaeans and Trojans suffered so much hardship, </p>

<p>thanks to the gods' decree ... </p>

<p>The lord of the warcry , Menelaus, asked at once </p>

<p>what pressing need had brought me to lovely Lacedaemon, </p>

<p>and when 1 told him the whole story, first to last, </p>

<p>the king burst out, 'How shameful! That's the bed </p>

<p>of a brave man of war they'd like to crawl inside, </p>

<p>those spineless, craven cowards! </p>

<p>Weak as the doe that beds down her fawns </p>

<p>in a mighty lion's den &mdash; her newborn sucklings &mdash; </p>

<p>then trails off to the mountain spurs and grassy bends </p>

<p>to graze her fill, but back the lion comes to his own lair </p>

<p>and the master deals both fawns a ghastly bloody death, </p>

<p>just what Odysseus will deal that mob &mdash; ghastly death. </p>

<p>Ah if only &mdash; Father Zeus, Athena and lord Apollo &mdash; </p>

<p>that man who years ago in the games at Lesbos </p>

<p>rose to Philomelides' challenge, wrestled him, </p>

<p>pinned him down with one tremendous throw </p>

<p>and the Argives roared with joy ... </p>

<p>if only ^Aa^ Odysseus sported with those suitors, </p>

<p>a blood wedding, a quick death would take the lot! </p>

<p>But about the things you've asked me, so intently, </p>

<p>I'll skew and sidestep nothing, not deceive you, ever. </p>

<p>Of all Aetold me &mdash; ^the Old Man of the Sea who never lies &mdash; </p>

<p>I'll hide or hold back nothing, not a single word. </p>

<p>He said he'd seen Odysseus on an island, </p>

<p>ground down in misery, off in a goddess' house, </p>

<p></p>

<p>the nymph Calypso, who holds him there by force.  He has no way to voyage home to his own native land,  no trim ships in reach, no crew to ply the oars  and send him scudding over the sea's broad back.' </p>

<p>So Menelaus, the famous spearman, told me.  My mission accomplished, back 1 came at once,  and the gods sent me a stiff following wind  that sped me home to the native land 1 love. ' </p>

<p>His reassurance stirred the queen to her depths  and the godUke seer Theocly menus added firmly,  &quot;Noble lady, wife of Laertes' son, Odysseus,  Menelaus can have no perfect revelations;  mark myyNords &mdash; 1 will make you a prophecy,  quite precise, and /U hold nothing back.  1 swear by Zeus, the first of all the gods,  by this table of hospitality here, my host,  by Odysseus' hearth where 1 have come for help &mdash;  1 swear Odysseus Js on native soil, here and now!  Poised or on the prowl, learning of these rank crimes  he's sowing seeds of ruin for all your suitors.  So clear, so true, that bird-sign 1 saw  as 1 sat on the benched ship  and sounded out the future to the prince!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;If only, my friend,&quot; reserved Penelope exclaimed,  &quot;everything you say would come to pass!  You'd soon know my affection, know my gifts.  Any man you meet would call you blest.&quot; </p>

<p>And so the three confided in the halls  while all the suitors, before Odysseus' palace,  amused themselves with discus and long throwing spears,  out on the leveled grounds, free and easy as always,  full of swagger. When the dinner-hour approached  and sheep came home from pastures near and far. </p>

<p></p>

<p>driven in by familiar drovers, </p>

<p>Medon called them all, their favorite herald, </p>

<p>always present at their meals: &quot;My young lords, </p>

<p>now you've played your games to your hearts' content, </p>

<p>come back to the halls so we can fix your supper. </p>

<p>Nothing's better than dining well on time!&quot; </p>

<p>They came at his summons, rising from the games  and now, bustling into the well-constructed palace,  flinging down their cloaks on a chair or bench,  they butchered hulking sheep and fatted goats,  full-grown hogs and a young cow from the herd,  preparing for their feast. </p>

<p>At the same time  the king and his loyal swineherd geared to leave  the country for the town. Eumaeus, foreman of men,  set things in motion: &quot;Friend, 1 know you're keen  on going down to town today , just as my master bid,  though I'd rather you stay here to guard the farm.  But 1 prize the boy, 1 fear he'll blame me later &mdash;  a dressing-down from your master's hard to bear.  So off we go now. The shank of the day is past.  You'll find it colder with nightfall coming on.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;1 know, 1 see your point,&quot; the crafty man replied.  &quot;There's sense in this old head. So let's be off.  And from now on, you lead me all the way.  Just give me a stick to lean on,  if you have one ready-cut. You say the road  is treacherous, full of slips and slides.&quot; </p>

<p>With that </p>

<p>he flung his beggar's sack across his shoulders &mdash;  torn and tattered, slung from a fraying rope.  Eumaeus gave him a staff that met his needs.  Then the two moved out, leaving behind them  dogs and herdsmen to stay and guard the farm.  And so the servant led his master toward the city,  looking for all the world like an old and broken beggar </p>

<p></p>

<p>hunched on a stick, his body wrapped in shameful rags ... </p>

<p>Down over the rugged road they went till hard by town  they reached the stone-rimmed fountain running clear  where the city people came and drew their water.  Ithacus built it once, with Neritus and Polyctor.  Round it a stand of poplar thrived on the dank soil,  all in a nestling ring, and down from a rock-ledge overhead  the cold water splashed, and crowning the fountain  rose an altar-stone erected to the nymphs,  where every traveler paused and left an offering.  Here Dolius' son, Melanthius, crossed their path,  herding his goats with a pair of drovers' help,  the pick of his flocks to make the suitors' meal.  As soon as he saw them there he broke into a flood  of brutal, foul abuse that made Odysseus' blood boil.  &quot;Look! &quot; &mdash; he sneered &mdash; &quot;one scum nosing another scum along,  dirt finds dirt by the will of god &mdash; it never fails!  Stinking pig-boy, where do you take your filthy swine,  this sickening beggar who licks the pots at feasts?  Hanging round the doorposts, rubbing his back,  scavenging after scraps,  no hero's swords and cauldrons, not for him.  Hand him over to me &mdash; I'll teach him to work a farm,  muck out my stalls, pitch feed to the young goats;  whey to drink will put some muscle on his hams!  Oh no, he's learned his lazy ways too well,  he's got no itch to stick to good hard work,  he'd rather go scrounging round the countryside,  begging for crusts to stuff his greedy gut!  Let me tell you &mdash; so help me it's the truth &mdash;  if he sets foot in King Odysseus' royal palace,  salvos of footstools flung at his head by all the lords  will crack his ribs as he runs the line of fire through the house!&quot; </p>

<p>Wild, reckless taunts &mdash; and just as he passed Odysseus  the idiot lurched out with a heel and kicked his hip,  but he couldn't knock the beggar off the path. </p>

<p></p>

<p>he stood his ground so staunchly. Odysseus was torn ... </p>

<p>should he wheel with his staff and beat the scoundrel senseless? &mdash; </p>

<p>or hoist him by the midriff, split his skull on the rocks? </p>

<p>He steeled himself instead, his mind in full control. </p>

<p>But Eumaeus glared at the goatherd, cursed him to his face, </p>

<p>then lifted up his hands and prayed his heart out: </p>

<p>&quot;0 nymphs of the fountain, daughters of Zeus &mdash; </p>

<p>if Odysseus ever burned you the long thighs </p>

<p>of lambs or kids, covered with rich fat, </p>

<p>now bring my prayer to pass! </p>

<p>Let that man come back &mdash; some god guide him now! </p>

<p>He'd toss to the winds the flashy show you make, </p>

<p>Melanthius, so cocksure &mdash; always strutting round the town </p>

<p>while worthless fieldhands leave your flocks a shambles!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Listen to /limf the goatherd shouted back.  &quot;All bark and no bite from the vicious mutt!  One fine day I'll ship him out in a black lugger,  miles from Ithaca &mdash; sell him off for a good stiff price!  Just let Apollo shoot Telemachus down with his silver bow,  today in the halls, or the suitors snuff his life out &mdash;  as sure as 1 know the day of the king's return  is blotted out, the king is worlds away!&quot; </p>

<p>With his parting shot he left them trudging on  and went and reached the royal house in no time.  Slipping in, he took his seat among the suitors,  facing Eurymachus, who favored him the most.  The carvers set before him his plate of meat,  a staid housekeeper brought the man his bread. </p>

<p>And now at last the king and loyal swineherd,  drawing near the palace, halted just outside  as the lyre's rippling music drifted round them &mdash;  Phemius, striking up a song for assembled guests &mdash;  and the master seized his servant's hand, exclaiming,  &quot;Friend, what a noble house! Odysseus 'house, it must be!  No mistaking it &mdash; you could tell it among a townful, look. </p>

<p></p>

<p>One building linked to the next, and the courtyard wall  is finished off with a fine coping, the double doors  are battle-proof &mdash; no man could break them down!  1 can tell a crowd is feasting there in force &mdash;  smell the savor of roasts ... the ringing lyre, listen,  the lyre that god has made the friend of feasts. &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;An easy guess,&quot; you said, Eumaeus, swineherd,  &quot;for a man as keen as you at every turn.  Put heads together. What do we do next?  Either you're the first one into the palace &mdash;  mix with the suitors, leave me where 1 am.  Or if you like, stay put, and I'll go first myself.  Don't linger long. Someone might spot you here outside,  knock you down or pelt you. Mark my words. Take care.&quot; </p>

<p>The man who'd borne long years abroad replied,  &quot;Well 1 know. Remember? There's sense in this old head.  You go in, you first, while 1 stay here behind.  Stones and blows and 1 are hardly strangers.  My heart is steeled by now,  I've had my share of pain in the waves and wars.  Add this to the total. Bring the trial on.  But there's no way to hide the belly's hungers &mdash;  what a curse, what mischief it brews in all our lives!  Just for hunger we rig and ride our long benched ships  on the barren salt sea, speeding death to enemies.&quot; </p>

<p>Now, as they talked on, a dog that lay there  lifted up his muzzle, pricked his ears ...  It was Argos, long-enduring Odysseus' dog  he trained as a puppy once, but little joy he got  since all too soon he shipped to sacred Troy.  In the old days young hunters loved to set him  coursing after the wild goats and deer and hares.  But now with his master gone he lay there, castaway,  on piles of dung from mules and cattle, heaps collecting  out before the gates till Odysseus' serving-men </p>

<p></p>

<p>could cart it off to manure the king's estates. </p>

<p>Infested with ticks, half -dead from neglect, </p>

<p>here lay the hound, old Argos. </p>

<p>But the moment he sensed Odysseus standing by </p>

<p>he thumped his tail, nuzzling low, and his ears dropped, </p>

<p>though he had no strength to drag himself an inch </p>

<p>toward his master. Odysseus glanced to the side </p>

<p>and flicked away a tear, hiding it from Eumaeus, </p>

<p>diverting his friend in a hasty, offhand way: </p>

<p>&quot;Strange, Eumaeus, look, a dog like this, </p>

<p>lying here on a dung-hill ... </p>

<p>what handsome lines! But 1 can't say for sure </p>

<p>if he had the running speed to match his looks </p>

<p>or he was only the sort that gentry spoil at table, </p>

<p>show-dogs masters pamper for their points.&quot; </p>

<p>You told the stranger, Eumaeus, loyal swineherd,  &quot;Here &mdash; it's all too true &mdash; here's the dog of a man  who died in foreign parts. But if he had now  the form and flair he had in his glory days &mdash;  as Odysseus left him, sailing off to Troy &mdash;  you'd be amazed to see such speed, such strength.  No quarry he chased in the deepest, darkest woods  could ever slip this hound. A champion tracker too!  Ah, but he's run out of luck now, poor fellow ...  his master's dead and gone, so far from home,  and the heartless women tend him not at all. Slaves,  with their lords no longer there to crack the whip,  lose all zest to perform their duties well. Zeus,  the Old Thunderer, robs a man of half his virtue  the day the yoke clamps down around his neck.&quot; </p>

<p>With that he entered the well-constructed palace,  strode through the halls and joined the proud suitors.  But the dark shadow of death closed down on Argos' eyes  the instant he saw Odysseus, twenty years away. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Now Prince Telemachus, first by far to note  the swineherd coming down the hall, nodded briskly,  called and waved him on. Eumaeus, glancing about,  picked up a handy stool where the carver always sat,  slicing meat for the suitors feasting through the house.  He took and put it beside the prince's table, facing him,  straddled it himself as a steward set a plate of meat  before the man and served him bread from trays. </p>

<p>Right behind him came Odysseus, into his own house,  looking for all the world like an old and broken beggar  hunched on a stick, his body wrapped in shameful rags.  Just in the doorway , just at the ashwood threshold,  there he settled down ... </p>

<p>leaning against the cypress post a master joiner  planed smooth and hung with a plumb line gears ago.  Telemachus motioned the swineherd over now,  and choosing a whole loaf from a fine wicker tray  and as much meat as his outstretched hands could hold,  he said, &quot;Now take these to the stranger, tell him too  to make the rounds of the suitors, beg from one and all.  Bashfulness, for a man in need, is no great friend.&quot; </p>

<p>And Eumaeus did his bidding, went straight up  to the guest and winged a greeting: &quot;Here, stranger.  Prince Telemachus sends you these, and tells you too  to make the rounds of the suitors, beg from one and all.  Bashfulness for a beggar, he says, is no great friend.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Powerful Zeus!&quot; the crafty king responded,  &quot;grant that your prince be blest among mankind &mdash;  and all his heart's desires come to pass!&quot; </p>

<p>Taking the food in both hands, setting it down,  spread out on his filthy sack before his feet,  the beggar fell to his meal  as the singer raised a song throughout the house.  Once he'd supped and the stirring bard had closed,  the suitors broke into uproar down along the hall. </p>

<p></p>

<p>And now Athena came to the side of Laertes' royal son </p>

<p>and urged him, &quot;Go now, gather crusts from all the suitors, </p>

<p>test them, so we can tell the innocent from the guilty.&quot; </p>

<p>But not even so would Athena save one man from death. </p>

<p>Still, off he went, begging from each in turn, </p>

<p>circUng left to right, reaching out his hand </p>

<p>like a beggar from the day that he was born. </p>

<p>They pitied him, gave him scraps, were puzzled too, </p>

<p>asking each other, &quot;Who is this? &quot; &quot;Where's he from?&quot; </p>

<p>Till the goatherd Melanthius shouted out in their midst, </p>

<p>&quot;Listen to me, you lords who court our noble queen &mdash; </p>

<p>I'll tell you about the stranger. I've seen him before. </p>

<p>1 know for a fact the swineherd led him in, </p>

<p>though 1 have no idea who the fellow is </p>

<p>or where he thinks he comes from.&quot; </p>

<p>At that </p>

<p>Antinous wheeled on Eumaeus, lashing out at him:  &quot;Your highness, swineherd &mdash; why drag this\.o town?  Haven't we got our share of vagabonds to deal with,  disgusting beggars who lick the feasters' plates?  Isn't it quite enough, these swarming crowds  consuming your master's bounty &mdash;  must you invite this rascal in the bargain?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Antinous, </p>

<p>highborn as you are,&quot; you told the man, Eumaeus, </p>

<p>&quot;that was a mean low speech! </p>

<p>Now who'd go out, who on his own hook &mdash; </p>

<p>not 1 &mdash; and ask a stranger in from nowhere </p>

<p>unless he had some skills to serve the house? </p>

<p>A prophet, a healer who cures disease, a worker in wood </p>

<p>or even a god-inspired bard whose singing warms the heart &mdash; </p>

<p>they'reXhe ones asked in around the world. A beggar? </p>

<p>Who'd invite a beggar to bleed his household white? </p>

<p>You, you of all the suitors are always roughest </p>

<p>on the servants of our king, on memosl of all. </p>

<p>Not that 1 care, no, so long as his queen, </p>

<p>his wise queen, is still alive in the palace, </p>

<p></p>

<p>Prince Telemachus too.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Stop, Eumaeus,&quot;  poised Telemachus broke in quickly now,  &quot;don't waste so much breath on Antinous here.  It's just his habit to bait a man with abuse  and spur the rest as well. &quot; </p>

<p>He wheeled on the suitor,  letting loose: &quot;How kind you are to me, Antinous,  kind as a father to his son! Encouraging me  to send this stranger packing from my house  with a harsh command! I'd never do it. God forbid.  Take and give to the beggar. 1 don't grudge it &mdash;  I'd even urge you on. No scruples now,  never fear your gifts will upset my mother  or any servant in King Odysseus' royal house.  But no such qualm could enter that head of yours,  bent on feeding your own face, not feeding strangers!&quot; </p>

<p>Antinous countered the young prince in kind:  &quot;So high and mighty, Telemachus &mdash; such unbridled rage!  If all the suitors gave him the sort of gift I'll give,  the house would be rid of him for three whole months!&quot;  With that from under his table be seized the stool  that propped his smooth feet as he reveled on &mdash;  just lifting it into view ... </p>

<p>But as for the rest,  all gave to the beggar, filled his sack with handouts,  bread and meat. And Odysseus seemed at the point  of getting back to his doorsill,  done with testing suitors, home free himself  when he stopped beside Antinous, begging face-to-face:  &quot;Give me a morsel, friend. You're hardly the worst  Achaean here, it seems. The noblest one, in fact.  You look like a king to me!  So you should give a bigger crust than the rest  and 1 will sing your praises all across the earth.  1 too once lived in a lofty house that men admired; </p>

<p></p>

<p>rolling in wealth, I'd often give to a vagabond like myself, </p>

<p>whoever he was, whatever need had brought him to my door. </p>

<p>And crowds of servants 1 had, and lots of all it takes </p>

<p>to live the life of ease, to make men call you rich. </p>

<p>But Zeus ruined it all &mdash; god's will, no doubt &mdash; </p>

<p>when he shipped me off with a roving band of pirates </p>

<p>bound for Egypt, a long hard sail, to wreck my life. </p>

<p>There in the Nile delta 1 moored our ships of war. </p>

<p>God knows 1 ordered my trusty crews to stand by, </p>

<p>just where they were, and guard the anchored fleet </p>

<p>and 1 sent a patrol to scout things out from higher ground. </p>

<p>But swept away by their own reckless fury, the crew went berserk &mdash; </p>

<p>they promptly began to plunder the lush Egyptian farms, </p>

<p>dragged off the women and children, killed the men. </p>

<p>Outcries reached the city in no time &mdash; stirred by shouts </p>

<p>the entire town came streaming down at the break of day, </p>

<p>filling the river plain with chariots, ranks of infantry </p>

<p>and the gleam of bronze. Zeus who loves the lightning </p>

<p>flung down murderous panic on all my men-at-arms &mdash; </p>

<p>no one dared to stand his ground and fight, </p>

<p>disaster ringed us round from every quarter. </p>

<p>Droves of my men they hacked down with swords, </p>

<p>led off the rest alive, to labor for them as slaves. </p>

<p>Myself? They passed me on to a stranger come their way, </p>

<p>to ship me to Cyprus &mdash; lasus' son Dmetor it was, </p>

<p>who ruled Cyprus then with an iron fist. </p>

<p>And from there 1 sailed to Ithaca, </p>

<p>just as you see me now, ground down by pain and sorrow &mdash; &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Good god almighty!&quot; Antinous cut the beggar short.  &quot;What spirit brought this pest to plague our feast?  Back off! Into the open, clear of my table, or you,  you'll soon land in an Egypt, Cyprus, to break your heart!  What a brazen, shameless beggar! Scrounging food  from each man in turn, and look at their handouts,  reckless, never a qualm, no holding back, not  when making free with the next man's goods &mdash;  each one's got plenty here.&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Pity, pity,&quot;  the wry Odysseus countered, drawing away.  &quot;No sense in your head to match your handsome looks.  You'd grudge your servant a pinch of salt from your own larder,  you who lounge at the next man's board but lack the heart  to tear a crust of bread and hand it on to me,  though there's god's plenty here.&quot; </p>

<p>Boiling over </p>

<p>Antinous gave him a scathing look and let fly,  &quot;Now^ou won't get out of the hall unscarred, 1 swear,  not after such a filthy string of insults!&quot; </p>

<p>With that </p>

<p>he seized the stool and hurled it &mdash; </p>

<p>Square in the back  it struck Odysseus, just under the right shoulder  but he stood up against it &mdash; steady as a rock,  unstaggered by Antinous' blow&mdash; just shook his head,  silent, his mind churning with thoughts of bloody work.  Back he went to the doorsill, crouched, and setting down  his sack about to burst, he faced the suitors, saying,  &quot;Hear me out, you lords who court the noble queen,  1 must say what the heart inside me urges.  There's nothing to groan about, no hurt, when a man  takes a blow as he fights to save his own possessions,  cattle or shining flocks. But Antinous struck me  all because of my good-for-nothing belly &mdash; that,  that curse that makes such pain for us poor men.  But if beggars have their gods and Furies too,  let Antinous meet his death before he meets his bride!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Enough, stranger!&quot; Antinous volleyed back.  &quot;Sit there and eat in peace &mdash; or go get lost! Or else,  for the way you talk, these young men will hale you  up and down the halls by your hands or feet  until you're skinned alive!&quot; </p>

<p>Naked threats &mdash;  but the rest were outraged, even those brash suitors.  One would say to another, &quot;Look, Antinous,  that was a crime, to strike the luckless beggar!&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Your fate is sealed if he's some god from the blue. &quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;And the gods do take on the look of strangers  dropping in from abroad &mdash; &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Disguised in every way  as they roam and haunt our cities, watching over us &mdash; &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;All our foul play, all our fair play too!&quot; </p>

<p>So they warned, but Antinous paid no heed.  And the anguish welled up in Telemachus' breast  for the blow his father took, yet he let no tears  go rolling down his face &mdash; just shook his head,  silent, his mind churning with thoughts of bloody work. </p>

<p>But then, when cautious Queen Penelope heard  how Antinous struck the stranger, there in the halls,  she cried out, with her serving-women round her,  &quot;May Apollo the Archer strike you just as hard!&quot;  And her housekeeper Eurynome added quickly,  &quot;If only our prayers were granted &mdash;  then not one of the lot would live to see  Dawn climb her throne tomorrow!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Dear old woman,&quot;  alert Penelope replied, &quot;they're all hateful,  plotting their vicious plots. But Antinous  is the worst of all &mdash; he's black death itself.  Here's this luckless stranger, wandering down  the halls and begging scraps &mdash; hard-pressed by need &mdash;  and the rest all give the man his fill of food,  but that one gives him a footstool  hurled at his right shoulder, hits his back!&quot; </p>

<p>While she exclaimed among her household women,  sitting there in her room, Odysseus bent to supper.  Penelope called the swineherd in and gave instructions:  &quot;Go, good Eumaeus, tell the stranger to come at once.  I'd like to give him a warm welcome, ask the man </p>

<p></p>

<p>if he's heard some news about my gallant husband  or seen him in the flesh ... </p>

<p>He seems like one who's roved around the world.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;My queen, &quot; you answered, Eumaeus, loyal swineherd,  &quot;if only the lords would hold their peace a moment!  Such stories he tells &mdash; he'd charm you to your depths.  Three nights, three days 1 kept him in my shelter;  /was the first the fellow stumbled onto,  fleeing from some ship. But not even so  could he bring his tale of troubles to an end.  You know how you can stare at a bard in wonder &mdash;  trained by the gods to sing and hold men spellbound &mdash;  how you can long to sit there, listening, all your life  when the man begins to sing. So he charmed my heart,  1 tell you, huddling there beside me at my fire.  He and Odysseus' father go way back, he says,  sworn friends, and the stranger hails from Crete  where the stock of old King Minos still lives on,  and from Crete he made his way, racked by hardship,  tumbling on like a rolling stone until he turned up here.  He swears he's heard of Odysseus&mdash; just in reach,  in rich Thesprotian country &mdash; still alive,  laden with treasure, heading home at last!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Go,&quot; </p>

<p>the cautious queen responded, &quot;call him here </p>

<p>so he can tell me his own tale face-to-face. </p>

<p>Our friends can sit at the gates or down the halls </p>

<p>and play their games, debauched to their hearts' content. </p>

<p>Why not? Their own stores, their bread and seasoned wine, </p>

<p>lie intact at home; food for their serving-men alone. </p>

<p>But they, they infest our palace day and night, </p>

<p>they butcher our cattle, our sheep, our fat goats, </p>

<p>feasting themselves sick, swilling our glowing wine </p>

<p>as if there's no tomorrow &mdash; all of it, squandered. </p>

<p>No, there is no man like Odysseus in command </p>

<p>to drive this curse from the house. Dear god, </p>

<p>if only Odysseus came back home to native soil now, </p>

<p>he and his son would avenge the outrage of these men &mdash; like that!' </p>

<p></p>

<p>At her last words Telemachus shook with a lusty sneeze  and the sudden outburst echoed up and down the halls.  The queen was seized with laughter, calling out  to Eumaeus winged words: &quot;Quickly, go!  Bring me this stranger now, face-to-face!  You hear how my son sealed all 1 said with a sneeze?  Solet death come down with grim finality on these suitors &mdash;  one and all &mdash; not a single man escape his sudden doom!  And another thing. Mark my words, 1 tell you.  If I'm convinced that all he says is true,  I'll dress him in shirt and cloak, in handsome clothes. &quot; </p>

<p>Off the swineherd went, following her instructions,  made his way to the stranger's side and winged a word:  &quot;Old friend &mdash; our queen, wise Penelope, summons you,  the prince's mother! The spirit moves her now,  heartsick as she is, </p>

<p>to ask a question or two about her husband- </p>

<p>And if she's convinced that all you say is true, </p>

<p>she'll dress you in shirt and cloak. That's what you need, </p>

<p>that most of all now. Bread you can always beg </p>

<p>around the country, fill your belly well &mdash; </p>

<p>they'll give you food, whoever has a mind to.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Gladly, Eumaeus,&quot; the patient man replied,  &quot;I'll tell her the whole truth, and nothing but,  Icarius' daughter, your wise queen Penelope.  1 know all about that man ...  it's been my lot to suffer what he's suffered-  But 1 fear the mob's abuse, those rough young bucks,  their pride and violence hit the iron skies!  Just now that scoundrel &mdash; as 1 went down the halls,  harming no one &mdash; up and dealt me a jolting blow,  and who would raise a hand to save me? Telemachus?  Anyone else? No one. So tell Penelope now,  anxious as she may be, to wait in the halls  until the sun goes down. Then she can ask me </p>

<p></p>

<p>all she likes about her husband's journey home.  But let her give me a seat close by the fire.  The clothes on my back are tatters. Well you know &mdash;  you are the first 1 begged for care and shelter.&quot; </p>

<p>Back the swineherd went, following his instructions.  Penelope, just as he crossed her threshold, broke out,  &quot;Didn't you bring him? What's in the vagrant's mind?  Fear of someone? Embarrassed by something else,  here in the house? Is the fellow bashful?  A bashful man will make a sorry beggar. &quot; </p>

<p>You answered your queen, Eumaeus, loyal swineherd,  &quot;He talks to the point &mdash; he thinks as the next man would  who wants to dodge their blows, that brutal crew.  He tells you to wait here till the sun goes down.  It's better for you, my queen. Then you can talk  with the man in private, hear the stranger's news.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Nobody's fool, that stranger,&quot; wise Penelope said,  &quot;he sees how things could go. Surely no men on earth  can match that gang for reckless, deadly schemes.&quot; </p>

<p>So she agreed, and now, mission accomplished,  back the loyal swineherd went to mix with the suitors.  Moving next to the prince, he whispered a parting word,  their heads close together so no one else could hear.  &quot;Dear boy, 1 must be off, to see to the pigs  and the whole farm &mdash; your living, mine as well.  You're the one to tend to all things here.  Look out for your own skin first,  do take care, you mustn't come to grief.  Crowds of your own countrymen plot your death &mdash;  let Zeus wipe out the lot before they kill us all!&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Right you are, old friend, &quot; the canny prince replied.  &quot;Now off you go, once you've had your supper.  But come back bright and early,  bring some good sound boars for slaughter. Yes,  I'll tend to all things here, 1 and the deathless gods. &quot; </p>

<p>And the swineherd sat down again on his polished stool  and once he'd supped and drunk to his heart's content,  back he went to his pigs, leaving the royal precincts  still filled with f casters, all indulging now  in the joys of dance and song.  The day was over. Dusk was falling fast. </p>

<p>Book XVIII </p>

<p></p>

<p>The Beggar-King  of Ithaca </p>

<p></p>

<p>Now along came this tramp, this public nuisance </p>

<p>who used to scrounge a living round the streets of Ithaca &mdash; </p>

<p>notorious for his belly, a ravenous, bottomless pit </p>

<p>for food and drink, but he had no pith, no brawn, </p>

<p>despite the looming hulk that met your eyes. </p>

<p>Arnaeus was his name, </p>

<p>so his worthy mother called him at birth, </p>

<p>but all the young men called him Irus for short </p>

<p>because he'd hustle messages at any beck and call. </p>

<p>Well he came by to rout the king from his own house </p>

<p>and met Odysseus now with a rough, abusive burst: </p>

<p>&quot;Get off the porch, you old goat, before 1 haul you </p>

<p>off by the leg! Can't you see them give me the wink, </p>

<p>all of them here, to drag you out &mdash; and so 1 would. </p>

<p></p>

<p>but I've got some pangs of conscience. Up with you, man,  or before you know it, we'll be trading blows!&quot; </p>

<p>A killing look,  and the wily old soldier countered, &quot;Out of your mind?  What damage have 1 done you?Whai have 1 said?  1 don't grudge you anything,  not if the next man up and gives you plenty.  This doorsill is big enough for the both of us &mdash;  you've got no call to grudge me what's not yours.  You're another vagrant, just like me, I'd say,  and it lies with the gods to make us rich or poor. So,  keep your fists to yourself, don't press your luck, don't rile me,  or old as 1 am, I'll bloody your lip, splatter your chest  and buy myself some peace and quiet for tomorrow.  1 doubt you'll ever come lumbering back again  to the halls of Laertes' royal son Odysseus.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Look who's talking!&quot; the beggar rumbled in anger.  &quot;How this pot-bellied pig runs off at the mouth &mdash;  like an old crone at her oven!  Well y've got a knock-out blow in store for hjw &mdash;  I'll batter the tramp with both fists, bash every tooth  from his jaws, I'll litter the ground with teeth  like a rogue sow's, punished for rooting corn!  Belt up &mdash; so the lords can see us fight it out.  How can you beat a champion half your age?&quot; </p>

<p>Tongue-lashing each other, tempers flaring,  there on the polished sill before the lofty doors.  And Antinous, that grand prince, hearing them wrangle,  broke into gloating laughter, calling to the suitors,  &quot;Friends, nothing like this has come our way before &mdash;  what sport some god has brought the palace now!  The stranger and Irus, look,  they'd battle it out together, fists flying.  Come, let's pit them against each other &mdash; fast!&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>All leapt from their seats with whoops of laughter,  clustering round the pair of ragged beggars there  as Eupithes' son Antinous planned the contest.  &quot;Quiet, my fine friends. Here's what 1 propose.  These goat sausages sizzling here in the fire &mdash;  we packed them with fat and blood to have for supper.  Now, whoever wins this bout and proves the stronger,  let that man step up and take his pick of the lot!  What's more, from this day on he feasts among us &mdash;  no other beggar will we allow inside  to cadge his meals from us!' </p>

<p>They all cheered  but Odysseus, foxy veteran, plotted on ...  &quot;Friends, how can an old man, worn down with pain,  stand up to a young buck? It's just this belly of mine,  this trouble-maker, tempts me to take a licking.  So first, all of you swear me a binding oath:  come, not one of you steps in for Irus here,  strikes me a foul blow to pull him through  and lays me in the dust.&quot; </p>

<p>And at that  they all mouthed the oath that he required,  and once they vowed they'd never interfere.  Prince Telemachus drove the matter home:  &quot;Stranger, if your spine and fighting pride  prompt you to go against this fellow now,  have no fear of any suitor in the pack &mdash;  whoever fouls you will have to face a crowd.  Count on me, your host. And two lords back me up,  Antinous and Eurymachus &mdash; both are men of sense.&quot; </p>

<p>They all shouted approval of the prince  as Odysseus belted up, roping his rags around his loins,  baring his big rippling thighs &mdash; his boxer's broad shoulders,  his massive chest and burly arms on full display  as Athena stood beside him,  fleshing out the limbs of the great commander ...  Despite their swagger, the suitors were amazed. </p>

<p></p>

<p>gaping at one another, trading forecasts:  &quot;Irus will soon be ironed out for good!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;He's in for the beating he begged for all along.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Look at the ham on that old gaffer &mdash; &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Just under his rags!&quot; </p>

<p>Each outcry jolted Irus to the core &mdash; too late.  The servants trussed his clothes up, dragged him on,  the flesh on his body quaking now with terror.  Antinous rounded on him, flinging insults:  &quot;You, you clumsy ox, you're better off dead  or never born at all, if you cringe at him,  paralyzed with fear of an old, broken hulk,  ground down by the pains that hound his steps.  Mark my word &mdash; so help me I'll make it good &mdash;  if that old relic whips you and wins the day,  I'll toss you into a black ship and sail you off  to Echetus, the mainland king who wrecks all men alive!  He'll lop your nose and ears with his ruthless blade,  he'll rip your privates out by the roots, he will,  and serve them up to his dogs to bolt down raw!&quot; </p>

<p>That threat shook his knees with a stronger fit  but they hauled him into the ring. Both men put up their fists &mdash;  with the seasoned fighter Odysseus deeply torn now ...  should he knock him senseless, leave him dead where he dropped  or just stretch him out on the ground with a light jab?  As he mulled things over, that way seemed the best:  a glancing blow, the suitors would not detect him.  The two men squared off &mdash; </p>

<p>and Irus hurled a fist  at Odysseus' right shoulder as Aecame through  with a hook below the ear, pounding Irus' neck,  smashing the bones inside &mdash; </p>

<p>Suddenly red blood </p>

<p></p>

<p>came spurting out of his mouth, and headlong down  he pitched in the dust, howUng, teeth locked in a grin,  feet beating the ground &mdash; </p>

<p>And the princely suitors,  flinging their hands in the air, died laughing.  Grabbing him by the leg, Odysseus hauled him  through the porch, across the yard to the outer gate,  heaped him against the courtyard wall, sitting slumped,  stuck his stick in his hand and gave him a parting shot:  &quot;Now hold your post &mdash; play the scarecrow to all the pigs and dogs!  But no more lording it over strangers, no more playing  the beggar-king for you, you loathsome fool,  or you'll bring down something worse around your neck!&quot; </p>

<p>He threw his beggar's sack across his shoulders &mdash;  torn and tattered, slung from a fraying rope &mdash;  then back he went to the sill and took his seat.  The suitors ambled back as well, laughing] auntily,  toasting the beggar warmly now, those proud young blades,  one man egging the other on: &quot;Stranger, friend, may Zeus  and the other deathless gods fill up your sack with blessings!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;All your heart desires!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You've knocked him out of action, </p>

<p>that insatiable tramp &mdash; &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;That parasite on the land!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ship him off to Echetus, fast &mdash; the mainland king  who wrecks all men alive!&quot; </p>

<p>Welcome words  and a lucky omen too &mdash; Odysseus' heart leapt up.  Antinous laid before him a generous goat sausage,  bubbling fat and blood. Amphinomus took two loaves  from the wicker tray and set them down beside him,  drank his health in a golden cup and said,  &quot;Cheers, old friend, old father,  saddled now as you are with so much trouble &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>here's to your luck, great days from this day on!&quot; </p>

<p>And the one who knew the world replied at length,  &quot;Amphinomus, you seem like a man of good sense to me.  Just like your father &mdash; at least I've heard his praises,  Nisus of Dulichion, a righteous man, and rich.  You're his son, they say, you seem well-spoken, too.  So 1 will tell you something. Listen. Listen closely.  Of all that breathes and crawls across the earth,  our mother earth breeds nothing feebler than a man.  So long as the gods grant him power, spring in his knees,  he thinks he will never suffer affliction down the years.  But then, when the happy gods bring on the long hard times,  bear them he must, against his will, and steel his heart.  Our lives, our mood and mind as we pass across the earth,  turn as the days turn ... </p>

<p>as the father of men and gods makes each day dawn. </p>

<p>1 too seemed destined to be a man of fortune once, </p>

<p>and a wild wicked swath 1 cut, indulged my lust for violence, </p>

<p>staking all on my father and my brothers. </p>

<p>Look at me now.  And so, 1 say, let no man ever be lawless all his life,  just take in peace what gifts the gods will send. </p>

<p>True, </p>

<p>but here 1 see you suitors plotting your reckless work,  carving away at the wealth, affronting the loyal wife  of a man who won't be gone from kin and country long.  1 say he's right at hand &mdash; and may some power save you,  spirit you home before you meet him face-to-face  the moment he returns to native ground!  Once under his own roof, he and your friends,  believe you me, won't part till blood has flowed.&quot; </p>

<p>With that </p>

<p>he poured out honeyed wine to the gods and drank deeply,  then restored the cup to the young prince's hands.  Amphinomus made his way back through the hall,  heart sick with anguish, shaking his head,  fraught with grave forebodings ... </p>

<p></p>

<p>but not even so could he escape his fate.  Even then Athena had bound him fast to death  at the hands of Prince Telemachus and his spear.  Now back he went to the seat that he'd left empty. </p>

<p>But now the goddess Athena with her glinting eyes  inspired Penelope, Icarius' daughter, wary, poised,  to display herself to her suitors, fan their hearts,  inflame them more, and make her even more esteemed  by her husband and her son than she had been before.  Forcing a laugh, she called her maid: &quot;Eurynome,  my spirit longs &mdash; though it never did till now &mdash;  to appear before my suitors, loathe them as 1 do.  I'd say a word to my son too, for his own good,  not to mix so much with that pernicious crowd,  so glib with their friendly talk  but plotting wicked plots they'll hatch tomorrow. &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well said, my child, &quot; the old woman answered,  &quot;all to the point. Go to the boy and warn him now,  hold nothing back. But first you should bathe yourself,  give a gloss to your face. Don't go down like that &mdash;  your eyes dimmed, your cheeks streaked with tears.  It makes things worse, this grieving on and on.  Your son's now come of age &mdash; your fondest prayer  to the deathless gods, to see him wear a beard.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Eurynome,&quot; discreet Penelope objected,  &quot;don't try to coax me, care for me as you do,  to bathe myself, refresh my face with oils.  Whatever glow 1 had died long ago ...  the gods of Olympus snuffed it out that day  my husband sailed away in the hollow ships.  But please, have Autonoe and Hippodamia come  and support me in the hall. I'll never brave  those men alone. I'd be too embarrassed.&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>Now as the old nurse bustled through the house  to give the women orders, call them to the queen,  the bright-eyed goddess thought of one more thing.  She drifted a sound slumber over Icarius' daughter,  back she sank and slept, her limbs fell limp and still,  reclining there on her couch, all the while Athena,  luminous goddess, lavished immortal gifts on her  to make her suitors lose themselves in wonder ...  The divine unguent first. She cleansed her cheeks,  her brow and fine eyes with ambrosia smooth as the oils  the goddess Love applies, donning her crown of flowers  whenever she joins the Graces' captivating dances.  She made her taller, fuller in form to all men's eyes,  her skin whiter than ivory freshly carved, and now,  Athena's mission accomplished, off the bright one went  as bare-armed maids came in from their own quarters,  chattering all the way, and sleep released the queen.  She woke, touched her cheek with a hand, and mused,  &quot;Ah, what a marvelous gentle sleep, enfolding me  in the midst of all my anguish! Now if only  blessed Artemis sent me a death as gentle, now,  this instant &mdash; no more wasting away my life,  my heart broken in longing for my husband ...  He had every strength, </p>

<p>rising over his countrymen, head and shoulders.&quot; </p>

<p>Then, leaving her well-lit chamber, she descended,  not alone: two of her women followed close behind.  That radiant woman, once she reached her suitors,  drawing her glistening veil across her cheeks,  paused now where a column propped the sturdy roof,  with one of her loyal handmaids stationed either side.  The suitors' knees went slack, their hearts dissolved in lust &mdash;  all of them lifted prayers to lie beside her, share her bed.  But turning toward her son, she warned, &quot;Telemachus,  your sense of balance is not what it used to be.  When you were a boy you had much better judgment.  Now that you've grown and reached your young prime,  and any stranger, seeing how tall and handsome you are. </p>

<p></p>

<p>would think you the son of some great man of wealth &mdash;  now your sense of fairness seems to fail you.  Consider the dreadful thing just done in our halls &mdash;  how you let the stranger be 50 abused! Why,  suppose our guest, sitting here at peace,  here in our own house, </p>

<p>were hauled and badly hurt by such cruel treatment?  K7&pound;/'d be shamed, disgraced in all men's eyes!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Mother ... &quot; Telemachus paused, then answered.  &quot;1 cannot fault your anger at all this.  My heart takes note of everything, feels it, too,  both the good and the bad &mdash; the boy you knew is gone.  But how can 1 plan my world in a sane, thoughtful way?  These men drive me mad, hedging me round, right and left,  plotting their lethal plots, and no one takes my side.  Still, this battle between the stranger and Irus  hardly went as the suitors might have hoped:  the stranger beat him down!  If only &mdash; Father Zeus, Athena and lord Apollo &mdash;  these gallants, now, this moment, here in our house,  were battered senseless, heads lolling, knees unstrung,  some sprawled in the courtyard, some sprawled outside!  Slumped like Irus down at the front gates now,  whipped, and his head rolling like some drunk.  He can't stand up on his feet and stagger home,  whatever home he's got &mdash; the man's demolished.&quot; </p>

<p>So Penelope and her son exchanged their hopes  as Eury machus stepped in to praise the queen.  &quot;Ah, daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope,  if all the princes in Ionian Argos saw you now!  What a troop of suitors would banquet in your halls,  tomorrow at sunrise! You surpass all women  in build and beauty, refined and steady mind.&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Oh no, Eurymachus,&quot; wise Penelope demurred,  &quot;whatever form and feature I had, what praise I'd won,  the deathless gods destroyed that day the Achaeans  sailed away to Troy, my husband in their ships,  Odysseus &mdash; if could return to tend my life  the renown 1 had would only grow in glory.  Now my life is torment ... </p>

<p>look at the griefs some god has loosed against me! </p>

<p>I'll never forget the day he left this land of ours; </p>

<p>he caught my right hand by the wrist and said, gently, </p>

<p>'Dear woman, 1 doubt that every Achaean under arms </p>

<p>will make it home from Troy, all safe and sound. </p>

<p>The Trojans, they say, are fine soldiers too, </p>

<p>hurling javelins, shooting flights of arrows, </p>

<p>charioteers who can turn the tide &mdash; like that! &mdash; </p>

<p>when the great leveler. War, brings on some deadlock. </p>

<p>So 1 cannot tell if the gods will sail me home again </p>

<p>or I'll go down out there, on the fields of Troy, </p>

<p>but all things here must rest in your control. </p>

<p>Watch over my father and mother in the palace, </p>

<p>just as now, or perhaps a little more, </p>

<p>when 1 am far from home. </p>

<p>But once you see the beard on the boy's cheek, </p>

<p>you wed the man you like, and leave your house behind.' </p>

<p>So my husband advised me then. Now it all comes true ... </p>

<p>a night will come when a hateful marriage falls my lot &mdash; </p>

<p>this cursed life of mine! Zeus has torn away my joy. </p>

<p>But there's something else that mortifies me now. </p>

<p>Your way is a far cry from the time-honored way </p>

<p>of suitors locked in rivalry, striving to win </p>

<p>some noble woman, a wealthy man's daughter. </p>

<p>They bring in their own calves and lambs </p>

<p>to feast the friends of the bride-to-be, yes, </p>

<p>and shower her with gleaming gifts as well. </p>

<p>They don't devour the woman's goods scot-free.&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>staunch Odysseus glowed with joy to hear all this &mdash;  his wife's trickery luring gifts from her suitors now,  enchanting their hearts with suave seductive words  but all the while with something else in mind. </p>

<p>&quot;Gifts?&quot; </p>

<p>Eupithes' son Antinous took her point at once.  &quot;Daughter of Icarius, sensible Penelope,  whatever gifts your suitors would like to bring,  accept them. How ungracious to turn those gifts away!  We won't go back to our own estates, or anywhere else,  till you have wed the man you find the best. &quot; </p>

<p>So he proposed, and all the rest agreed.  Each suitor sent a page to go and get a gift.  Antinous' man brought in a grand, resplendent robe,  stiff with embroidery, clasped with twelve gold brooches,  long pins that clipped into sheathing loops with ease.  Eurymachus' man brought in a necklace richly wrought,  gilded, strung with amber and glowing like the sun.  Eurydamas' two men came with a pair of earrings,  mulberry clusters dangling in triple drops  with a glint to catch the heart.  From the halls of lord Pisander, Polyctor's son,  a servant brought a choker, a fine, gleaming treasure.  And so each suitor in turn laid on a handsome gift.  Then the noble queen withdrew to her upper room,  her file of waiting ladies close behind her,  bearing the gorgeous presents in their arms. </p>

<p>Now the suitors turned to dance and song,  to the lovely beat and sway,  waiting for dusk to come upon them there ...  and the dark night came upon them, lost in pleasure.  They rushed to set up three braziers along the walls  to give them light, piled them high with kindling,  sere, well-seasoned, just split with an ax,  and mixed in chips to keep the torches flaring. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The maids of Odysseus, steady man, took turns  to keep the fires up, but the king himself,  dear to the gods and cunning to the core,  gave them orders brusquely: &quot;Maids of Odysseus,  your master gone so long &mdash; quick now, off you go  to the room where your queen and mistress waits.  Sit with her there and try to lift her spirits,  combing wool in your hands or spinning yarn.  But 1 will trim the torches for all her suitors,  even if they would like to revel on till Morning  mounts her throne. They'll never wear me down.  1 have a name for lasting out the worst.&quot; </p>

<p>At that </p>

<p>the women burst into laughter, glancing back and forth. </p>

<p>Flushed with beauty, Melantho mocked him shamelessly &mdash; </p>

<p>Dolius was her father but Penelope brought her up; </p>

<p>she treated her like her own child and gave her toys </p>

<p>to cheer her heart. But despite that, her heart </p>

<p>felt nothing for all her mistress' anguish now. </p>

<p>She was Eury machus' lover, always slept with him. </p>

<p>She was the one who mocked her king and taunted, </p>

<p>&quot;Cock of the walk, did someone beat your brains out? </p>

<p>Why not go bed down at the blacksmith's cozy forge? </p>

<p>Or a public place where tramps collect? Why here &mdash; </p>

<p>blithering on, nonstop, </p>

<p>bold as brass in the face of all these lords? </p>

<p>No fear in your heart? Wine's got to your wits? &mdash; </p>

<p>or do you always play the fool and babble nonsense? </p>

<p>Lost your head, have you, because you drubbed that hobo Irus? </p>

<p>You wait &mdash; a better man than Irus will take you on, </p>

<p>he'll box both sides of your skull with heavy fists </p>

<p>and cart you out the palace gushing blood!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot; K7f/wait, </p>

<p>you bitch&quot; &mdash; ^the hardened veteran flashed a killing look.  &quot;I'll go straight to the prince with your foul talk.  The prince will chop you to pieces here and now!&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>His fury sent the women fluttering off, scattering  down the hall with panic shaking every limb &mdash;  they knew he spoke the truth.  But he took up his post by the flaring braziers,  tending the fires closely, looking after them all,  though the heart inside him stirred with other things,  ranging ahead, now, to all that must be done ... </p>

<p>But Athena had no mind to let the brazen suitors  hold back now from their heart-rending insults &mdash;  she meant to make the anguish cut still deeper  into the core of Laertes' son Odysseus.  Poly bus' son Eurymachus launched in first,  baiting the king to give his friends a laugh:  &quot;Listen to me, you lords who court our noble queen!  1 simply have to say what's on my mind. Look,  surely the gods have fetched this beggar here  to Odysseus' house. At least our torchlight seems  to come from the sheen of the man's own head &mdash;  there's not a hair on his bald pate, not a wisp!&quot; </p>

<p>Then he wheeled on Odysseus, raider of cities:  &quot;Stranger, how would you like to work for me  if 1 took you on &mdash; I'd give you decent wages &mdash;  picking the stones to lay a tight dry wall  or planting tall trees on the edge of my estate?  I'd give you rations to last you year-round,  clothes for your body, sandals for your feet.  Oh no, you've learned your lazy ways too well,  you've got no itch to stick to good hard work,  you'd rather go scrounging round the countryside,  begging for crusts to stuff your greedy gut!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ah, Eurymachus,&quot; Odysseus, master of many exploits,  answered firmly, &quot;if only the two of us could qo  man-to-man in the labors of the field ... </p>

<p></p>

<p>In the late spring, when the long days come round,  out in the meadow, 1 swinging a well-curved scythe  and you swinging yours &mdash; we'd test our strength for work,  fasting right till dusk with lots of hay to mow.  Or give us a team of oxen to drive, purebreds,  hulking, ruddy beasts, both lusty with fodder,  paired for age and puUing-power that never flags &mdash;  with four acres to work, the loam churning under the plow &mdash;  you'd see what a straight unbroken furrow 1 could cut you then.  Or if Zeus would bring some battle on &mdash; out of the blue,  this very day &mdash; and give me a shield and two spears  and a bronze helmet to fit this soldier's temples,  then you'd see me fight where front ranks clash &mdash;  no more mocking this belly of mine, not then.  Enough. You're sick with pride, you brutal fool.  No doubt you count yourself a great, powerful man  because you sport with a puny crowd, ill-bred to boot.  If only Odysseus came back home and stood right here,  in a flash you'd find those doors &mdash; broad as they are &mdash;  too cramped for your race to safety through the porch!&quot; </p>

<p>That made Eurymachus' fury seethe and burst &mdash;  he gave the beggar a dark look and let fly, &quot;You,  you odious &mdash; I'll make you pay for your ugly rant!  Bold as brass in the face of all these lords?  No fear in your heart? Wine's got to your wits? &mdash;  or do you always play the fool and babble nonsense?  Lost your head, have you, because you drubbed that hobo Irus?&quot; </p>

<p>As he shouted out he seized a stool, but Odysseus,  fearing the blow, crouched at Amphinomus' knees  as Eurymachus hurled and hit the wine-steward,  clipping his right hand &mdash;  his cup dropped, clattered along the floor  and flat on his back he went, groaning in the dust.  The suitors broke into uproar through the shadowed halls,  glancing at one another, trading angry outcries:  &quot;Would to god this drifter had dropped dead &mdash; &quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Anywhere else before he landed here!&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Then he'd never have loosed such pandemonium.&quot;  &quot;Now we're squabbling over beggars!' </p>

<p>&quot;No more joy </p>

<p>in the sumptuous feast ...&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Now riot rules the day!&quot; </p>

<p>But now Prince Telemachus dressed them down:  &quot;Fools, you're out of your minds! No hiding it,  food and wine have gone to your heads. Some god  has got your blood up. Come, now you've eaten well  go home to bed &mdash; when the spirit moves, that is.  /, for one, I'll drive no guest away.&quot; </p>

<p>So he declared. And they all bit their lips,  amazed the prince could speak with so much daring.  At last Amphinomus rose to take the floor,  the noted son of Nisus, King Aretias' grandson.  &quot;Fair enough, my friends; when a man speaks well  we have no grounds for wrangling, no cause for abuse.  Hands off the stranger! And any other servant  in King Odysseus' palace. Come, steward,  pour first drops for the god in every cup;  let's make libations, then go home to bed.  The stranger? Leave him here in Odysseus' halls  and have his host Telemachus, tend him well &mdash;  it's the prince's royal house the man has reached.&quot; </p>

<p>So he said. His proposal pleased them all.  And gallant Mulius, a herald of Dulichion,  a friend-in-arms of lord Amphinomus too,  mixed the men a bowl and, hovering closely,  poured full rounds for all. They tipped cups  to the blissful gods and then, libations made,  they drank the heady wine to their hearts' content  and went their ways to bed, each suitor to his house. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Penelope and  Her Guest </p>

<p></p>

<p>That left the great Odysseus waiting in his hall  as Athena helped him plot the slaughter of the suitors.  He turned at once to Telemachus, brisk with orders:  &quot;Now we must stow the weapons out of reach, my boy,  all the arms and armor &mdash; and when the suitors miss them  and ask you questions, put them off with a winning story:  '1 stowed them away, clear of the smoke. A far cry  from the arms Odysseus left when he went to Troy,  fire-damaged equipment, black with reeking fumes.  And a god reminded me of something darker too.  When you're in your cups a quarrel might break out,  you'd wound each other, shame your feasting here  and cast a pall on your courting.  Iron has powers to draw a man to ruin.' &quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>Telemachus did his father's will at once,  calling out to his old nurse Eurycleia: &quot;Quick,  dear one, close the women up in their own quarters,  till 1 can stow my father's weapons in the storeroom.  Splendid gear, lying about, neglected, black with soot  since father sailed away. 1 was only a boy then.  Now 1 must safeguard them from the smoke.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;High time, child, &quot; the loving nurse replied.  &quot;If only you'd bother to tend your whole house  and safeguard a//your treasures. Tell me,  who's to fetch and carry the torch for you?  You won't let out the maids who'd light your way.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Our friend here will,&quot; Telemachus answered coolly.  &quot;1 won't put up with a man who shirks his work,  not if he takes his ration from my stores,  even if he's miles away from home.&quot; </p>

<p>That silenced the old nurse.  She barred the doors that led from the long hall &mdash;  and up they sprang, Odysseus and his princely son,  and began to carry off the helmets, studded shields  and pointed spears, and Pallas Athena strode before them,  lifting a golden lamp that cast a dazzling radiance round about.  &quot;Father,&quot; Telemachus suddenly burst out to Odysseus,  &quot;oh what a marvel fills my eyes! Look, look there &mdash;  all the sides of the hall, the handsome crossbeams,  pinewood rafters, the tall columns towering &mdash;  all glow in my eyes like flaming fire!  Surely a god is here &mdash;  one of those who rule the vaulting skies!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Quiet,&quot; his father, the old soldier, warned him.  &quot;Get a grip on yourself. No more questions now.  It's just the way of the gods who rule Olympus.  Off you go to bed. I'll stay here behind  to test the women, test your mother too. </p>

<p></p>

<p>She in her grief will ask me everything 1 know. &quot; </p>

<p>Under the flaring torchlight, through the hall  Telemachus made his way to his own bedroom now,  where he always went when welcome sleep came on him.  There he lay tonight as well, till Dawn's first light.  That left the great king still waiting in his hall  as Athena helped him plot the slaughter of the suitors ... </p>

<p>Now down from her chamber came reserved Penelope,  looking for all the world like Artemis or golden Aphrodite.  Close to the fire her women drew her favorite chair  with its whorls of silver and ivory, inlaid rings.  The craftsman who made it years ago, Icmalius,  added a footrest under the seat itself,  mortised into the frame,  and over it all was draped a heavy fleece.  Here Penelope took her place, discreet, observant.  The women, arms bared, pressing in from their quarters,  cleared away the tables, the heaped remains of the feast  and the cups from which the raucous lords had drunk.  Raking embers from the braziers onto the ground,  they piled them high again with seasoned wood,  providing light and warmth. </p>

<p>And yet again  Melantho lashed out at Odysseus: &quot;You still here? &mdash;  you pest, slinking around the house all night,  leering up at the women? </p>

<p>Get out, you tramp &mdash; be glad of the food you got &mdash;  or we'll sling a torch at you, rout you out at once!&quot; </p>

<p>A killing glance, and the old trooper countered,  &quot;What's possessed you, woman? Why lay into me? Such abuse!  Just because I'm filthy, because 1 wear such rags,  roving round the country, living hand-to-mouth.  But it's fate that drives me on:  that's the lot of beggars, homeless drifters.  1 too once lived in a lofty house that men admired; </p>

<p></p>

<p>rolling in wealth, I'd often give to a vagabond like myself, </p>

<p>whoever he was, whatever need had brought him to my door. </p>

<p>And crowds of servants 1 had, and lots of all it takes </p>

<p>to live the life of ease, to make men call you rich. </p>

<p>But Zeus ruined it all &mdash; god's will, no doubt. </p>

<p>So beware, woman, or one day you may lose it all, </p>

<p>all your glitter that puts your work-mates in the shade. </p>

<p>Or your mistress may just fly in a rage and dress you down </p>

<p>or Odysseus may return &mdash; there's still room for hope! </p>

<p>Or if he's dead as you think and never coming home, </p>

<p>well there's his son, Telemachus ... </p>

<p>like father, like son &mdash; thanks to god Apollo. </p>

<p>No women's wildness here in the house escapes </p>

<p>the prince's eye. He's come of age at last. &quot; </p>

<p>So he warned, and alert Penelope heard him,  wheeled on the maid and tongue-lashed her smartly:  &quot;Make no mistake, you brazen, shameless bitch,  none of your ugly work escapes me either &mdash;  you will pay for it with your life, you will!  How well you knew &mdash; you heard from my own lips &mdash;  that 1 meant to probe this stranger in our house  and ask about my husband ... my heart breaks for him.&quot; </p>

<p>She turned to her housekeeper Eurynome and said,  &quot;Now bring us a chair and spread it soft with fleece,  so our guest can sit and tell me his whole story  and hear me out as well.  I'd like to ask him questions, point by point.&quot; </p>

<p>Eurynome bustled off to fetch a polished chair  and set it down and spread it soft with fleece.  Here Odysseus sat, the man of many trials,  as cautious Penelope began the conversation:  &quot;Stranger, let me start our questioning myself ...  Who are you? where are you from? your city? your parents?&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;My good woman,&quot; Odysseus, master of craft, replied,  &quot;no man on the face of the earth could find fault with you.  Your fame, believe me, has reached the vaulting skies.  Fame like a flawless king's who dreads the gods,  who governs a kingdom vast, proud and strong &mdash;  who upholds justice, true, and the black earth  bears wheat and barley, trees bow down with fruit  and the sheep drop lambs and never fail and the sea  teems with fish &mdash; thanks to his decent, upright rule,  and under his sovereign sway the people flourish.  So then, here in your house, ask me anything else  but don't, please, search out my birth, my land,  or you'll fill my heart to overflowing even more  as 1 bring back the past ...  1 am a man who's had his share of sorrows.  It's wrong for me, in someone else's house,  to sit here moaning and groaning, sobbing so &mdash;  it makes things worse, this grieving on and on.  One of your maids, or you yourself, might scold me,  think it's just the wine that had doused my wits  and made me drown in tears.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;No, no, stranger,&quot; wise Penelope demurred,  &quot;whatever form and feature 1 had, what praise I'd won,  the deathless gods destroyed that day the Achaeans  sailed away to Troy, my husband in their ships,  Odysseus &mdash; if could return to tend my life  the renown 1 had would only grow in glory.  Now my life is torment ... </p>

<p>look at the griefs some god has loosed against me!  All the nobles who rule the islands round about,  Dulichion, Same, and wooded Zacynthus too,  and all who lord it in sunny Ithaca itself &mdash;  they court me against my will, they lay waste my house.  So 1 pay no heed to strangers, suppliants at my door,  not even heralds out on their public errands here &mdash;  1 yearn for Odysseus, always, my heart pines away.  They rush the marriage on, and 1 spin out my wiles.  A god from the blue it was inspired me first </p>

<p></p>

<p>to set up a great loom in our royal halls </p>

<p>and 1 began to weave, and the weaving finespun, </p>

<p>the yarns endless, and 1 would lead them on: Young men, </p>

<p>my suitors, now that King Odysseus is no more, </p>

<p>go slowly, keen as you are to marry me, until </p>

<p>1 can finish off this web ... </p>

<p>so my weaving won't all fray and come to nothing. </p>

<p>This is a shroud for old lord Laertes, for that day </p>

<p>when the deadly fate that lays us out at last will take him down. </p>

<p>1 dread the shame my countrywomen would heap upon me, </p>

<p>yes, if a man of such wealth should lie in state </p>

<p>without a shroud for cover.' </p>

<p>My very words,  and despite their pride and passion they believed me.  So by day I'd weave at my great and growing web &mdash;  by night, by the light of torches set beside me,  1 would unravel all I'd done. Three whole years  1 deceived them blind, seduced them with this scheme.  Then, when the wheeling seasons brought the fourth year on  and the months waned and the long days came round once more,  then, thanks to my maids &mdash; the shameless, reckless creatures &mdash;  the suitors caught me in the act, denounced me harshly.  So 1 finished it off. Against my will. They forced me.  And now 1 cannot escape a marriage, nor can 1 contrive  a deft way out. My parents urge me to tie the knot  and my son is galled as they squander his estate &mdash;  he sees it all. He's a grown man by now, equipped  to tend to his own royal house and tend it well:  Zeus grants my son that honor ...  But for all that &mdash; now tell me who you are.  Where do you come from? You've hardly sprung  from a rock or oak like some old man of legend. &quot; </p>

<p>The master improviser answered, slowly,  &quot;My lady ... wife of Laertes' son, Odysseus,  will your questions about my family never end?  All right then. Here's my story. Even though  it plunges me into deeper grief than 1 feel now. </p>

<p></p>

<p>But that's the way of the world, when one has been  so far from home, so long away as I, roving over  many cities of men, enduring many hardships. </p>

<p>Still, </p>

<p>my story will tell you all you need to know. </p>

<p>There is a land called Crete ...  ringed by the wine-dark sea with rolling whitecaps &mdash;  handsome country, fertile, thronged with people  well past counting &mdash; boasting ninety cities,  language mixing with language side-by -side.  First come the Achaeans, then the native Cretans,  hardy, gallant in action, then Cydonian clansmen,  Dorians living in three tribes, and proud Pelasgians last.  Central to all their cities is magnificent Cnossos,  the site where Minos ruled and each ninth year  conferred with almighty Zeus himself. Minos,  father of my father, Deucalion, that bold heart.  Besides myself Deucalion sired Prince Idomeneus,  who set sail for Troy in his beaked ships of war,  escorting Atreus' sons. My own name is Aethon.  1 am the younger-born;  my older brother's a better man than 1 am.  Now, it was there in Cnossos that 1 saw him ...  Odysseus &mdash; and we traded gifts of friendship.  A heavy gale had landed him on our coast,  driven him way off course, rounding Malea's cape  when he was bound for Troy. He anchored in Amnisus,  hard by the goddess' cave of childbirth and labor,  that rough harbor &mdash; barely riding out the storm.  He came into town at once, asking for Idomeneus,  claiming to be my brother's close, respected friend.  Too late. Ten or eleven days had already passed  since he set sail for Troy in his beaked ships.  So 1 took Odysseus back to my own house,  gave him a hero's welcome, treated him in style &mdash;  stores in our palace made for princely entertainment.  As for his comrades, all who'd shipped with him. </p>

<p></p>

<p>I dipped into public stock to give them barley,  ruddy wine and fine cattle for slaughter,  beef to their hearts' content. A dozen days  they stayed with me there, those brave Achaeans,  penned up by a North Wind so stiff that a man,  even on dry land, could never keep his feet &mdash;  some angry spirit raised that blast, I'd say.  Then on the thirteenth day the wind died down  and they set sail for Troy.&quot; </p>

<p>Falsehoods all,  but he gave his falsehoods all the ring of truth.  As she listened on, her tears flowed and soaked her cheeks  as the heavy snow melts down from the high mountain ridges,  snow the West Wind piles there and the warm East Wind thaws  and the snow, melting, swells the rivers to overflow their banks &mdash;  so she dissolved in tears, streaming down her lovely cheeks,  weeping for him, her husband, sitting there beside her.  Odysseus' heart went out to his grief-stricken wife  but under his lids his eyes remained stock-still &mdash;  they might have been horn or iron &mdash;  his guile fought back his tears. And she,  once she'd had her fill of grief and weeping,  turned again to her guest with this reply:  &quot;Now, stranger, 1 think I'll test you, just to see  if there in your house, with all his friends-in-arms,  you actually entertained my husband as you say.  Come, tell me what sort of clothing he wore,  what cut of man was he?  What of the men who followed in his train?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ah good woman,&quot;  Odysseus, the great master of subtlety, returned,  &quot;how hard it is to speak, after so much time  apart ... why, some twenty years have passed  since he left my house and put my land behind him.  Even so, imagine the man as 1 portray him &mdash;  1 can see him now. </p>

<p>King Odysseus ...  he was wearing a heavy woolen cape, sea-purple. </p>

<p></p>

<p>in double folds, with a golden brooch to clasp it,  twin sheaths for the pins, on the face a work of art:  a hound clenching a dappled fawn in its front paws,  slashing it as it writhed. All marveled to see it,  solid gold as it was, the hound slashing, throttling  the fawn in its death-throes, hoofs flaiUng to break free.  1 noticed his glossy tunic too, clinging to his skin  like the thin glistening skin of a dried onion,  silky, soft, the glint of the sun itself.  Women galore would gaze on it with relish.  And this too. Bear it in mind, won't you?  I've no idea if Odysseus wore these things at home  or a comrade gave him them as he boarded ship,  or a host perhaps &mdash; the man was loved by many.  There were few Achaeans to equal him ... and 1?  1 gave him a bronze sword myself, a lined cloak,  elegant, deep red, and a fringed shirt as well,  and 1 saw him off in his long benched ship of war  in lordly style. </p>

<p>Something else. He kept a herald  beside him, a man a little older than himself.  I'll try to describe him to you, best 1 can.  Round-shouldered he was, swarthy, curly-haired.  His name? Eurybates. And Odysseus prized him  most of all his men. Their minds worked as one.&quot; </p>

<p>His words renewed her deep desire to weep,  recognizing the strong clear signs Odysseus offered.  But as soon as she'd had her fill of tears and grief,  Penelope turned again to her guest and said,  &quot;Now, stranger, much as 1 pitied you before,  now in my house you'll be my special friend,  my honored guest. 1 am the one, myself,  who gave him the very clothes that you describe.  1 brought them up from the storeroom, folded them nea  fastened the golden brooch to adorn my husband,  Odysseus &mdash; never again will 1 embrace him,  striding home to his own native land. </p>

<p></p>

<p>A black day it was </p>

<p>when he took ship to see that cursed city ...  Destroy, I call it &mdash; 1 hate to say its name!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ah my queen,&quot; the man of craft assured her,  &quot;noble wife of Laertes' son, Odysseus,  ravage no more your lovely face with tears  or consume your heart with grieving for your husband.  Not that I'd blame you, ever. Any woman will mourn  the bridegroom she has lost, lain with in love  and borne his children too. Even though he  was no Odysseus &mdash; a man like a god, they say.  But dry your tears and take my words to heart.  1 will tell you the whole truth and hide nothing:  1 have heard Odysseus now, at last, is on his way,  he's just in reach, in rich Thesprotian country &mdash;  the man is still alive </p>

<p>and he's bringing home a royal hoard of treasure,  gifts he won from the people of those parts.  His crew? He's lost his crew and hollow ship  on the wine-dark waters off Thrinacia Island.  Zeus and Helios raged, dead set against Odysseus  for his men-at-arms had killed the cattle of the Sun,  so down to the last hand they drowned in crashing seas.  But not Odysseus, clinging tight to his ship's keel &mdash;  the breakers flung him out onto dry land, on Scheria,  the land of Phaeacians, close kin to the gods themselves,  and with all their hearts they prized him like a god,  showered the man with gifts, and they'd have gladly  sailed him home unscathed. In fact Odysseus  would have been here beside you long ago,  but he thought it the better, shrewder course  to recoup his fortunes roving through the world.  At sly profit-turning there's not a man alive  to touch Odysseus. He's got no rival there.  So 1 learned from Phidon, king of Thesprotia,  who swore to me as he poured libations in his house,  'The ship's hauled down and the shipmates set to sail. </p>

<p></p>

<p>to take Odysseus home to native land.' </p>

<p>Butl... </p>

<p>he shipped me off before. A Thesprotian cutter  chanced to be heading for Dulichion rich in wheat.  But he showed me all the treasure Odysseus had amassed,  enough to last a man and ten generations of his heirs &mdash;  so great the wealth stored up for him in the king's vaults!  But Odysseus, he made clear, was off at Dodona then  to hear the will of Zeus that rustles forth  from the god's tall leafy oak: how should he return,  after all the years away, to his own beloved Ithaca,  openly or in secret? </p>

<p>And so the man is safe,  as you can see, and he's coming home, soon,  he's close, close at hand &mdash;  he won't be severed long from kin and country,  no, not now. 1 give you my solemn, binding oath.  1 swear by Zeus, the first, the greatest god &mdash;  by Odysseus' hearth, where 1 have come for help:  all will come to pass, 1 swear, exactly as 1 say.  True, this very month&mdash; just as the old moon dies  and the new moon rises into life &mdash; Odysseus will return!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;If only, my friend,&quot; reserved Penelope exclaimed,  &quot;everything you say would come to pass!  You'd soon know my affection, know my gifts.  Any man you meet would call you blest.  But my heart can sense the way it all will go.  Odysseus, 1 tell you, is never coming back,  nor will you ever gain your passage home,  for we have no masters in our house like him  at welcoming in or sending off an honored guest.  Odysseus. There was a man, or was he all a dream?  But come, women, wash the stranger and make his bed,  with bedding, blankets and lustrous spreads to keep him warm  till Dawn comes up and takes her golden throne.  Then, tomorrow at daybreak, bathe him well  and rub him down with oil, so he can sit beside </p>

<p></p>

<p>Telemachus in the hall, enjoy his breakfast there. </p>

<p>And anyone who offends our guest beyond endurance &mdash; </p>

<p>he defeats himself; he's doomed to failure here, </p>

<p>no matter how raucously he raves and blusters on. </p>

<p>For how can you know, my friend, if 1 surpass </p>

<p>all women in thoughtf ulness and shrewd good sense, </p>

<p>if I'd allow you to take your meals at hall </p>

<p>so weatherbeaten, clad in rags and tatters? </p>

<p>Our lives are much too brief ... </p>

<p>If a man is cruel by nature, cruel in action, </p>

<p>the mortal world will call down curses on his head </p>

<p>while he is alive, and all will mock his memory after death. </p>

<p>But then if a man is kind by nature, kind in action, </p>

<p>his guests will carry his fame across the earth </p>

<p>and people all will praise him from the heart.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Wait, my queen,&quot; the crafty man objected,  &quot;noble wife of Laertes' son, Odysseus &mdash;  blankets and glossy spreads? They 're not my style.  Not from the day 1 launched out in my long-oared ship  and the snowy peaks of Crete went fading far astern.  I'll lie as I've done through sleepless nights before.  Many a night I've spent on rugged beds afield,  waiting for Dawn to mount her lovely throne.  Nor do 1 pine for any footbaths either.  Of all the women who serve your household here,  not one will touch my feet. Unless, perhaps,  there is some old retainer, the soul of trust,  someone who's borne as much as 1 have borne ...  1 wouldn't mind if 5Ae would touch my feet.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Dear friend,  the discreet Penelope replied, &quot;never has any man  so thoughtful &mdash; of all the guests in my palace  come from foreign parts &mdash; been as welcome as you ...  so sensible, so apt, is every word you say.  1 have just such an old woman, seasoned, wise,  who carefully tended my unlucky husband, reared him,  took him into her arms the day his mother bore him &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>frail as the woman is, she'll wash your feet.  Up with you now, my good old Eurycleia,  come and wash your master's ... equal in years.  Odysseus must have feet and hands like his by now &mdash;  hardship can age a person overnight.&quot; </p>

<p>At that name  the old retainer buried her face in both hands,  burst into warm tears and wailed out in grief,  &quot;Oh my child, how helpless 1 am to help you now!  How Zeus despised you, more than all other men,  god-fearing man that you were ...  Never did any mortal burn the Old Thunderer  such rich thighbones &mdash; offerings charred and choice &mdash;  never as many as you did, praying always to reach  a ripe old age and raise a son to glory. Now,  you alone he's robbed of your home-coming day!  Just so, the women must have mocked my king,  far away, when he'd stopped at some fine house &mdash;  just as all these bitches, stranger, mock you here.  And because you shrink from their taunts, their wicked barbs,  you will not let them wash you. The work is mine &mdash;  Icarius' daughter, wise Penelope, bids me now  and 1 am all too glad, /will wash your feet,  both for my own dear queen and for yourself &mdash;  your sorrows wring my heart ... and why?  Listen to me closely, mark my words.  Many a wayworn guest has landed here  but never, 1 swear, has one so struck my eyes &mdash;  your build, your voice, your feet &mdash; you're like Odysseus ...  to the life!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Old woman,&quot; wily Odysseus countered,  &quot;that's what they all say who've seen us both.  We bear a striking resemblance to each other,  as you have had the wit to say yourself. &quot; </p>

<p>The old woman took up a burnished basin  she used for washing feet and poured in bowls  of fresh cold water before she stirred in hot. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Odysseus, sitting full in the firelight, suddenly  swerved round to the dark, gripped by a quick misgiving &mdash;  soon as she touched him she might spot the scar!  The truth would all come out. </p>

<p>Bending closer  she started to bathe her master ... then,  in a flash, she knew the scar &mdash; </p>

<p>that old wound  made years ago by a boar's white tusk when Odysseus  went to Parnassus, out to see Autolycus and his sons.  The man was his mother's noble father, one who excelled  the world at thievery, that and subtle, shifty oaths.  Hermes gave him the gift, overjoyed by the thighs  of lambs and kids he burned in the god's honor &mdash;  Hermes the ready partner in his crimes. Now,  Autolycus once visited Ithaca's fertile land,  to find his daughter 's son had just been born.  Eurycleia set him down on the old man's knees  as he finished dinner, urging him, &quot;Autolycus,  you must find a name for your daughter's darling son.  The baby comes as the answer to her prayers.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You, </p>

<p>my daughter, and you, my son-in-law,&quot; Autolycus returned, </p>

<p>&quot;give the boy the name 1 tell you now. Just as 1 </p>

<p>have come from afar, creating pain for many &mdash; </p>

<p>men and women across the good green earth &mdash; </p>

<p>so let his name be Odysseus... </p>

<p>the Son of Pain, a name he'll earn in full. </p>

<p>And when he has come of age and pays his visit </p>

<p>to Parnassus &mdash; ^the great estate of his mother's line </p>

<p>where all my treasures lie &mdash; 1 will give him enough </p>

<p>to cheer his heart, then speed him home to you.&quot; </p>

<p>And so, </p>

<p>in time, Odysseus went to collect the splendid gifts.  Autolycus and the sons of Autolycus warmed him in  with eager handclasps, hearty words of welcome.  His mother's mother, Amphithea, hugged the boy  and kissed his face and kissed his shining eyes. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Autolycus told his well-bred sons to prepare  a princely feast. They followed orders gladly,  herded an ox inside at once, five years old,  skinned it and split the carcass into quarters,  deftly cut it in pieces, skewered these on spits,  roasted all to a turn and served the portions out.  So all day long till the sun went down they feasted,  consuming equal shares to their hearts' content.  Then when the sun had set and night came on  they turned to bed and took the gift of sleep. </p>

<p>As soon </p>

<p>as young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more </p>

<p>they all moved out for the hunt, hounds in the lead, </p>

<p>Autolycus' sons and Prince Odysseus in their ranks. </p>

<p>Climbing Parnassus' ridges, thick with timber&quot;, </p>

<p>they quickly reached the mountain's windy folds </p>

<p>and just as the sun began to strike the plowlands, </p>

<p>rising out of the deep calm flow of the Ocean River, </p>

<p>the beaters came to a wooded glen, the hounds broke, </p>

<p>hot on a trail, and right behind the pack they came, </p>

<p>Autolycus' sons &mdash; Odysseus out in front now, </p>

<p>pressing the dogs, brandishing high his spear </p>

<p>with its long shadow waving. Then and there </p>

<p>a great boar lay in wait, in a thicket lair so dense </p>

<p>that the sodden gusty winds could never pierce it, </p>

<p>nor could the sun's sharp rays invade its depths </p>

<p>nor a downpour drench it through and through, </p>

<p>so dense, so dark, and piled with fallen leaves. </p>

<p>Here, as the hunters closed in for the kill, </p>

<p>crowding the hounds, the tramp of men and dogs </p>

<p>came drumming round the boar &mdash; he crashed from his lair, </p>

<p>his razor back bristling, his eyes flashing fire </p>

<p>and charging up to the hunt he stopped, at bay &mdash; </p>

<p>and Odysseus rushed him first, </p>

<p>shaking his long spear in a sturdy hand, </p>

<p>wild to strike but the boar struck faster, </p>

<p>lunging in on the slant, a tusk thrusting up </p>

<p>over the boy 's knee, gouging a deep strip of flesh </p>

<p></p>

<p>but it never hit the bone &mdash; </p>

<p>Odysseus thrust and struck,  stabbing the beast's right shoulder &mdash; </p>

<p>a glint of bronze &mdash;  the point ripped clean through, and down in the dust he dropped,  grunting out his breath as his life winged away.  The sons of Autolycus, working over Odysseus,  skillfully binding up his open wound &mdash;  the gallant, godlike prince &mdash;  chanted an old spell that stanched the blood  and quickly bore him home to their father's palace.  There, in no time, Autolycus and the sons of Autolycus  healed him well and, showering him with splendid gifts,  sped Odysseus back to his native land, to Ithaca,  a young man filled with joy . His happy parents,  his father and noble mother, welcomed him home  and asked him of all his exploits, blow-by-blow:  how did he get that wound? He told his tale with style,  how the white tusk of a wild boar had gashed his leg,  hunting on Parnassus with Autolycus and his sons ... </p>

<p>That scar &mdash; </p>

<p>as the old nurse cradled his leg and her hands passed down </p>

<p>she felt it, knew it, suddenly let his foot fall &mdash; </p>

<p>down it dropped in the basin &mdash; ^the bronze clanged, </p>

<p>tipping over, spilling water across the floor. </p>

<p>Joy and torment gripped her heart at once, </p>

<p>tears rushed to her eyes &mdash; ^voice choked in her throat </p>

<p>she reached for Odysseus' chin and whispered quickly, </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes! you are Odysseus&mdash; oh dear boy &mdash; </p>

<p>1 couldn't know you before ... </p>

<p>not till 1 touched the body of my king!&quot; </p>

<p>She glanced at Penelope, keen to signal her  that here was her own dear husband, here and now,  but she could not catch the glance, she took no heed,  Athena turned her attention elsewhere. But Odysseus &mdash;  his right hand shot out, clutching the nurse's throat,  with his left he hugged her to himself and muttered. </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Nurse, you want to kill me? You suckled me yourself </p>

<p>at your own breast &mdash; and now I'm home, at last, </p>

<p>after bearing twenty years of brutal hardship, </p>

<p>home, on native ground. But now you know, </p>

<p>now that a god has flashed it in your mind, </p>

<p>quiet! not a word to anyone in the house. </p>

<p>Or else, 1 warn you &mdash; and 1 mean business too &mdash; </p>

<p>if a god beats down these brazen suitors at my hands, </p>

<p>1 will not spare you &mdash; my old nurse that you are &mdash; </p>

<p>when 1 kill the other women in my house.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Child, &quot; shrewd old Eurycleia protested,  &quot;what nonsense you let slip through your teeth!  You know me &mdash; I'm stubborn, never give an inch &mdash;  I'll keep still as solid rock or iron.  One more thing. Take it to heart, 1 tell you.  If a god beats down these brazen suitors at your hands,  I'll report in full on the women in your house:  who are disloyal to you, who are guiltless.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Nurse,&quot; the cool tactician Odysseus said,  &quot;why bother to count them off? A waste of breath.  I'll observe them, judge each one myself.  Just be quiet. Keep your tales to yourself.  Leave the rest to the gods.&quot; </p>

<p>Hushed so,  the old nurse went padding along the halls  to fetch more water &mdash; her basin had all spilled &mdash;  and once she'd bathed and rubbed him down with oil,  Odysseus drew his chair up near the fire again,  trying to keep warm, </p>

<p>but he hid his scar beneath his beggar's rags </p>

<p>as cautious Penelope resumed their conversation: </p>

<p>&quot;My friend, 1 have only one more question for you, </p>

<p>something slight, now the hour draws on for welcome sleep &mdash; </p>

<p>for those who can yield to sweet repose, that is, </p>

<p>heartsick as they are. As for myself, though, </p>

<p>some god has sent me pain that knows no bounds. </p>

<p></p>

<p>All day long 1 indulge myself in sighs and tears </p>

<p>as 1 see to my tasks, direct the household women. </p>

<p>When night foils and the world lies lost in sleep, </p>

<p>1 take to my bed, my heart throbbing, about to break, </p>

<p>anxieties swarming, piercing &mdash; 1 may go mad with grief. </p>

<p>Like Pandareus' daughter, the nightingale in the green woods </p>

<p>lifting her lovely song at the first warm rush of spring, </p>

<p>perched in the treetops' rustling leaves and pouring forth </p>

<p>her music shifting, trilling and sinking, rippling high to burst </p>

<p>in grief for Itylus, her beloved boy. King Zethus' son </p>

<p>whom she in innocence once cut down with bronze ... </p>

<p>so my wavering heart goes shuttUng, back and forth: </p>

<p>Do 1 stay beside my son and keep all things secure &mdash; </p>

<p>my lands, my serving- women, the grand high-roofed house &mdash; </p>

<p>true to my husband's bed, the people's voice as well? </p>

<p>Or do 1 follow, at last, the best man who courts me </p>

<p>here in the halls, who gives the greatest gifts? </p>

<p>My son &mdash; ^when he was a boy and lighthearted &mdash; </p>

<p>urged me not to marry and leave my husband's house. </p>

<p>But now he has grown and reached his young prime, </p>

<p>he begs me to leave our palace, travel home. </p>

<p>Telemachus, so obsessed with his own estate, </p>

<p>the wealth my princely suitors bleed away. </p>

<p>But please, </p>

<p>read this dream for me, won't you? Listen closely ... </p>

<p>1 keep twenty geese in the house, from the water trough </p>

<p>they come and peck their wheat &mdash; 1 love to watch them all. </p>

<p>But down from a mountain swooped this great hook-beaked eagle, </p>

<p>yes, and he snapped their necks and killed them one and all </p>

<p>and they lay in heaps throughout the halls while he, </p>

<p>back to the clear blue sky he soared at once. </p>

<p>But /wept and wailed &mdash; only a dream, of course &mdash; </p>

<p>and our well-groomed ladies came and clustered round me, </p>

<p>sobbing, stricken: the eagle killed my geese. But down </p>

<p>he swooped again and settling onto a jutting rafter </p>

<p>called out in a human voice that dried my tears, </p>

<p>'Courage, daughter of famous King Icarius! </p>

<p>This is no dream but a happy waking vision. </p>

<p></p>

<p>real as day, that will come true for you.  The geese were your suitors &mdash; 1 was once the eagle  but now 1 am your husband, back again at last,  about to launch a terrible fate against them all!'  So he vowed, and the soothing sleep released me.  1 peered around and saw my geese in the house,  pecking at their wheat, at the same trough  where they always took their meal.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Dear woman,&quot;  quick Odysseus answered, &quot;twist it however you like,  your dream can only mean one thing. Odysseus  told you himself &mdash; he'll make it come to pass.  Destruction is clear for each and every suitor;  not a soul escapes his death and doom.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Ah my friend,&quot; seasoned Penelope dissented,  &quot;dreams are hard to unravel, wayward, drifting things &mdash;  not all we glimpse in them will come to pass ...  Two gates there are for our evanescent dreams,  one is made of ivory, the other made of horn.  Those that pass through the ivory cleanly carved  are will-o'-the-wisps, their message bears no fruit.  The dreams that pass through the gates of polished horn  are fraught with truth, for the dreamer who can see them.  But 1 can't believe my strange dream has come that way,  much as my son and 1 would love to have it so.  One more thing I'll tell you &mdash; ^weigh it well.  The day that dawns today, this cursed day,  will cut me off from Odysseus' house. Now,  1 mean to announce a contest with those axes,  the ones he would often line up here inside the hall,  twelve in a straight unbroken row like blocks to shore a keel,  then stand well back and whip an arrow through the lot.  Now 1 will bring them on as a trial for my suitors.  The hand that can string the bow with greatest ease,  that shoots an arrow clean through all twelve axes &mdash;  he's the man 1 follow, yes, forsaking this house  where 1 was once a bride, this gracious house </p>

<p></p>

<p>so filled with the best that life can offer &mdash;  I shall always remember it, that I know ...  even in my dreams.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Oh my queen,&quot;  Odysseus, man of exploits, urged her on,  &quot;royal wife of Laertes' son, Odysseus, now,  don't put off this test in the halls a moment.  Before that crew can handle the polished bow,  string it taut and shoot through all those axes &mdash;  Odysseus, man of exploits, will be home with you!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;If only, my friend,&quot; the wise Penelope replied,  &quot;you were willing to sit beside me in the house,  indulging me in the comfort of your presence,  sleep would never drift across my eyes.  But one can't go without his sleep forever.  The immortals give each thing its proper place  in our mortal lives throughout the good green earth.  So now I'm going back to my room upstairs  and lie down on my bed,  that bed of pain my tears have streaked, year in,  year out, from the day Odysseus sailed away to see ...  Destroy, 1 call it &mdash; 1 hate to say its name!  There I'll rest, while you lie here in the hall,  spreading your blankets somewhere on the floor,  or the women will prepare a decent bed.&quot; </p>

<p>With that </p>

<p>the queen went up to her lofty well-lit room </p>

<p>and not alone: her women followed close behind. </p>

<p>Penelope, once they reached the upper story, </p>

<p>fell to weeping for Odysseus, her beloved husband, </p>

<p>till watchful Athena sealed her eyes with welcome sleep. </p>

<p>Book XX </p>

<p></p>

<p>Portents Gather </p>

<p></p>

<p>Off in the entrance-hall the great king made his bed,  spreading out on the ground the raw hide of an ox,  heaping over it fleece from sheep the suitors  butchered day and night, then Eurynome threw  a blanket over him, once he'd nestled down.  And there Odysseus lay ...  plotting within himself the suitors' death &mdash;  awake, alert, as the women slipped from the house,  the maids who whored in the suitors' beds each night,  tittering, linking arms and frisking as before.  The master's anger rose inside his chest,  torn in thought, debating, head and heart &mdash;  should he up and rush them, kill them one and all  or let them rut with their lovers one last time?  The heart inside him growled low with rage, </p>

<p></p>

<p>as a bitch mounting over her weak, defenseless puppies </p>

<p>growls, facing a stranger, bristling for a showdown &mdash; </p>

<p>so he growled from his depths, hackles rising at their outrage. </p>

<p>But he struck his chest and curbed his fighting heart: </p>

<p>&quot;Bear up, old heart! You've borne worse, far worse, </p>

<p>that day when the Cyclops, man-mountain, bolted </p>

<p>your hardy comrades down. But you held fast &mdash; </p>

<p>Nobody but your cunning pulled you through </p>

<p>the monster's cave you thought would be your death. &quot; </p>

<p>So he forced his spirit into submission,  the rage in his breast reined back &mdash; unswerving,  all endurance. But he himself kept tossing, turning,  intent as a cook before some white-hot blazing fire  who rolls his sizzling sausage back and forth,  packed with fat and blood &mdash; keen to broil it quickly,  tossing, turning it, this way, that way &mdash; so he cast about:  how could he get these shameless suitors in his clutches,  one man facing a mob? ... when close to his side she came,  Athena sweeping down from the sky in a woman's build  and hovering at his head, the goddess spoke:  &quot;Why still awake? The unluckiest man alive!  Here is your house, your wife at home, your son,  as fine a boy as one could hope to have. &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;True,&quot; </p>

<p>the wily fighter replied, &quot;how right you are, goddess,  but still this worry haunts me, heart and soul &mdash;  how can 1 get these shameless suitors in my clutches?  Single-handed, braving an army always camped inside.  There's another worry, that haunts me even more.  What if 1 kill them &mdash; ^thanks to you and Zeus &mdash;  how do 1 run from under their avengers?  Show me the way, 1 ask you.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Impossible man!&quot;  Athena bantered, the goddess' eyes ablaze.  &quot;Others are quick to trust a weaker comrade,  some poor mortal, far less cunning than 1.  But 1 am a goddess, look, the very one who </p>

<p></p>

<p>guards you in all your trials to the last. </p>

<p>1 tell you this straight out: </p>

<p>even if fifty bands of mortal fighters </p>

<p>closed around us, hot to kill us off in battle, </p>

<p>still you could drive away their herds and sleek flocks! </p>

<p>So, surrender to sleep at last. What a misery, </p>

<p>keeping watch through the night, wide awake &mdash; </p>

<p>you'll soon come up from under all your troubles.&quot; </p>

<p>With that she showered sleep across his eyes  and back to Olympus went the lustrous goddess.  As soon as sleep came on him, loosing his limbs,  slipping the toils of anguish from his mind,  his devoted wife awoke and,  sitting up in her soft bed, returned to tears.  When the queen had wept to her heart's content  she prayed to the Huntress, Artemis, first of all:  &quot;Artemis &mdash; goddess, noble daughter of Zeus, if only  you'd whip an arrow through my breast and tear my life out,  now, at once! Or let some whirlwind pluck me up  and sweep me away along those murky paths and  fling me down where the Ocean River running  round the world rolls back upon itself! </p>

<p>Quick </p>

<p>as the whirlwinds swept away Pandareus' daughters &mdash; </p>

<p>years ago, when the gods destroyed their parents, </p>

<p>leaving the young girls orphans in their house. </p>

<p>But radiant Aphrodite nursed them well </p>

<p>on cheese and luscious honey and heady wine, </p>

<p>and Hera gave them beauty and sound good sense, </p>

<p>more than all other women &mdash; ^virgin Artemis made them tall </p>

<p>and Athena honed their skills to fashion lovely work. </p>

<p>But then, when Aphrodite approached Olympus' peaks </p>

<p>to ask for the girls their crowning day as brides </p>

<p>from Zeus who loves the lightning &mdash; Zeus who knows all, </p>

<p>all that's fated, all not fated, for mortal man &mdash; </p>

<p>then the storm spirits snatched them away </p>

<p></p>

<p>and passed them on to the hateful Furies,  yes, for all theirloving care. </p>

<p>Just so </p>

<p>may the gods who rule Olympus blot me out! </p>

<p>Artemis with your glossy braids, come shoot me dead &mdash; </p>

<p>so 1 can plunge beneath this loathsome earth </p>

<p>with the image of Odysseus vivid in my mind. </p>

<p>Never let me warm the heart of a weaker man! </p>

<p>Even grief is bearable, true, when someone weeps </p>

<p>through the days, sobbing, heart convulsed with pain, </p>

<p>yet embraced by sleep all night &mdash; sweet oblivion, sleep </p>

<p>dissolving all, the good and the bad, once it seals our eyes &mdash; </p>

<p>but even my dreams torment me, sent by wicked spirits. </p>

<p>Again &mdash; just this night &mdash; someone lay beside me ... </p>

<p>like Odysseus to the life, when he embarked </p>

<p>with his men-at-arms. My heart raced with joy . </p>

<p>No dream, 1 thought, the waking truth at last!&quot; </p>

<p>At those words  Dawn rose on her golden throne in a sudden gleam of light.  And great Odysseus caught the sound of his wife's cry  and began to daydream &mdash; deep in his heart it seemed  she stood beside him, knew him, now, at last ...  Gathering up the fleece and blankets where he'd slept,  he laid them on a chair in the hall, he took the oxhide out  and spread it down, lifted his hands and prayed to Zeus:  &quot;Father Zeus, if you really willed it so &mdash; ^to bring me  home over land and sea-lanes, home to native ground  after all the pain you brought me &mdash; show me a sign,  a good omen voiced by someone awake indoors,  another sign, outside, from Zeus himself!&quot; </p>

<p>And Zeus in all his wisdom heard that prayer.  He thundered at once, out of his clear blue heavens  high above the clouds, and Odysseus' spirit lifted.  Then from within the halls a woman grinding grain  let fly a lucky word. Close at hand she was,  where the good commander set the handmills once </p>

<p></p>

<p>and now twelve women in all performed their tasks, </p>

<p>grinding the wheat and barley, marrow of men's bones. </p>

<p>The rest were abed by now &mdash; they 'd milled their stint &mdash; </p>

<p>this one alone, the frailest of all, kept working on. </p>

<p>Stopping her mill, she spoke an omen for her master: </p>

<p>&quot;Zeus, Father! King of gods and men, now there </p>

<p>was a crack of thunder out of the starry sky &mdash; </p>

<p>and not a cloud in sight! </p>

<p>Sure it's a sign you're showing someone now. </p>

<p>So, poor as 1 am, grant mern^ prayer as well: </p>

<p>let this day be the last, the last these suitors </p>

<p>bolt their groaning feasts in King Odysseus' house! </p>

<p>These brutes who break my knees &mdash; heart-wrenching labor, </p>

<p>grinding their grain &mdash; now let them eat their last! &quot; </p>

<p>A lucky omen, linked with Zeus's thunder.  Odysseus' heart leapt up, the man convinced  he'd grind the scoundrels' lives out in revenge. </p>

<p>By now </p>

<p>the other maids were gathering in Odysseus' royal palace,  raking up on the hearth the fire still going strong.  Telemachus climbed from bed and dressed at once,  brisk as a young god &mdash; </p>

<p>over his shoulder he slung his well-honed sword,  he fastened rawhide sandals under his smooth feet,  he seized his tough spear tipped with a bronze point  and took his stand at the threshold, calling Eury cleia:  &quot;Dear nurse, how did you treat the stranger in our house?  With bed and board? Or leave him to lie untended?  That would be mother's way &mdash; sensible as she is &mdash;  all impulse, doting over some worthless stranger,  turning a good man out to face the worst.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Please, child,&quot; his calm old nurse replied,  &quot;don't blame Aer&mdash; your mother's blameless this time.  He sat and drank his wine till he'd had his fill.  Food? He'd lost his hunger. But she asked him. </p>

<p></p>

<p>And when it was time to think of turning in,  she told the maids to spread a decent bed, but he &mdash;  so down-and-out, poor soul, so dogged by fate &mdash;  said no to snuggling into a bed, between covers.  No sir, the man lay down in the entrance-hall,  on the raw hide of an ox and sheep's fleece,  and we threw a blanket over him, so we did. &quot; </p>

<p>Hearing that, </p>

<p>Telemachus strode out through the palace, spear in hand,  and a pair of sleek hounds went trotting at his heels.  He made for the meeting grounds to join the island lords  while Eurycleia the daughter of Ops, Pisenor's son,  that best of women, gave the maids their orders:  &quot;Quick now, look alive, sweep out the house,  wet down the floors! </p>

<p>You, those purple coverlets,  fling them over the fancy chairs! </p>

<p>All those tables,  sponge them down &mdash; scour the winebowls, burnished cups!  The rest &mdash; now off you go to the spring and fetch some water,  fast as your legs can run! </p>

<p>Our young gallants won't be long from the palace,  they'll be bright and early &mdash; ^today's a public feast.&quot; </p>

<p>They hung on her words and ran to do her bidding.  Full twenty scurried off to the spring's dark water,  others bent to the housework, all good hands.  Then in they trooped, the strutting serving-men,  who split the firewood cleanly now as the women  bustled in from the spring, the swineherd at their heels,  driving three fat porkers, the best of all his herds.  And leaving them to root in the broad courtyard,  up he went to Odysseus, hailed him warmly:  &quot;Friend, do the suitors show you more respect  or treat you like the dregs of the earth as always?&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Good Eumaeus, &quot; the crafty man replied,  &quot;if only the gods would pay back their outrage!  Wild and reckless young cubs, conniving here  in another's house. They've got no sense of shame.&quot; </p>

<p>And now as the two confided in each other,  the goatherd Melanthius sauntered toward them,  herding his goats with a pair of drovers' help,  the pick of his flocks to make the suitors' meal.  Under the echoing porch he tethered these, then turned  on Odysseus once again with cutting insults: &quot;Still alive?  Still hounding your betters, begging round the house?  Why don't you cart yourself away? Get out!  We'll never part, 1 swear,  till we taste each other's fists. Riffraff,  you and your begging make us sick! Get out &mdash;  we're hardly the only banquet on the island.&quot; </p>

<p>No reply. The wily one just shook his head,  silent, his mind churning with thoughts of bloody work ... </p>

<p>Third to arrive was Philoetius, that good cowherd,  prodding in for the crowd a heifer and fat goats.  Boatmen had brought them over from the mainland,  crews who ferry across all travelers too,  whoever comes for passage.  Under the echoing porch he tethered all heads well  and then approached the swineherd, full of questions:  &quot;Who's this stranger, Eumaeus, just come to the house?  What roots does the man claim &mdash; who are his people?  Where are his blood kin? his father's fields?  Poor beggar. But what a build &mdash; a royal king's!  Ah, once the gods weave trouble into our lives  they drive us across the earth, they drown us all in pain,  even kings of the realm.&quot; </p>

<p>And with that thought  he walked up to Odysseus, gave him his right hand  and winged a greeting: &quot;Cheers, old friend, old father,  here's to your luck, great days from this day on &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>saddled now as you are with so much trouble! </p>

<p>Father Zeus, no god's more deadly than you. </p>

<p>No mercy for men, you give them life yourself </p>

<p>then plunge them into misery, brutal hardship. </p>

<p>1 broke into sweat, my friend, when 1 first saw you &mdash; </p>

<p>see, my eyes still brim with tears, remembering him, </p>

<p>Odysseus ... He must wear such rags, 1 know it, </p>

<p>knocking about, drifting through the world </p>

<p>if he's still alive and sees the light of day. </p>

<p>If he's dead already, lost in the House of Death, </p>

<p>my heart aches for Odysseus, my great lord and master. </p>

<p>He set me in charge of his herds, in Cephallenian country, </p>

<p>when 1 was just a youngster. How they've grown by now, </p>

<p>past counting! No mortal on earth could breed </p>

<p>a finer stock of oxen &mdash; broad in the brow, </p>

<p>they thrive like ears of corn. But just look, </p>

<p>these interlopers tell me to drive them in </p>

<p>for their own private feasts. Not a thought </p>

<p>for the young prince in the house, they never flinch &mdash; </p>

<p>no regard for the gods' wrath &mdash; in their mad rush </p>

<p>to carve up his goods, my master gone so long! </p>

<p>I'm tossed from horn to horn in my own mind ... </p>

<p>What a traitor I'd be, with the prince alive, </p>

<p>if I'd run off to some other country, herds and all, </p>

<p>to a new set of strangers. Ah, but isn't it worse </p>

<p>to hold out here, tending the herds for upstarts, </p>

<p>not their owners &mdash; suffering all the pains of hell? </p>

<p>1 could have fled, ages ago, to some great king </p>

<p>who'd give me shelter. It's unbearable here. </p>

<p>True, but 1 still dream of my old master, </p>

<p>unlucky man &mdash; if only hd&amp;amp; drop in from the blue </p>

<p>and drive these suitors all in a rout throughout the halls!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Cowherd,&quot; the cool tactician Odysseus answered,  &quot;you're no coward, and nobody's fool, I'd say.  Even 1 can see there's sense in that old head.  So 1 tell you this on my solemn, binding oath:  1 swear by Zeus, the first of all the gods &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>by the table of hospitality waiting for us,  by Odysseus' hearth where 1 have come for help,  Odysseus will come home while you're still here.  You'll see with your own eyes, if you have the heart,  these suitors who lord it here cut down in blood. &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Stranger, if only,&quot; the cowherd cried aloud,  &quot;if only Zeus would make that oath come true &mdash;  you'd see my power, my fighting arms in action!&quot; </p>

<p>Eumaeus echoed his prayer to all the gods  that their wise king would soon come home again. </p>

<p>Now as they spoke and urged each other on,  and once more the suitors were plotting certain doom  for the young prince &mdash; suddenly, banking high on the left  an omen flew past, an eagle clutching a trembling dove.  And Amphinomus rose in haste to warn them all,  &quot;My friends, we'll never carry off this plot  to kill the prince. Let's concentrate on feasting.&quot; </p>

<p>His timely invitation pleased them all.  The suitors ambled into Odysseus' royal house  and flinging down their cloaks on a chair or bench,  they butchered hulking sheep and fatted goats,  full-grown hogs and a young cow from the herd.  They roasted all the innards, served them round  and filled the bowls with wine and mixed it well.  Eumaeus passed out cups; Philoetius, trusty herdsman,  brought on loaves of bread in ample wicker trays;  Melanthius poured the wine. The whole company  reached out for the good things that lay at hand. </p>

<p>Telemachus, maneuvering shrewdly, sat his father down  on the stone threshold, just inside the timbered hall,  and set a rickety stool and cramped table there.  He gave him a share of innards, poured his wine </p>

<p></p>

<p>in a golden cup and added a bracing invitation: </p>

<p>&quot;Now sit right there. Drink your wine with the crowd. </p>

<p>I'll defend you from all their taunts and blows, </p>

<p>these young bucks. This is no public place, </p>

<p>this is Odysseus 'house &mdash; </p>

<p>my father won it for me, so it's mine. </p>

<p>You suitors, control yourselves. No insults now, </p>

<p>no brawling, no, or it's war between us all.&quot; </p>

<p>So he declared. And they all bit their lips,  amazed the prince could speak with so much daring.  Only Eupithes' son Antinous ventured,  &quot;Fighting words, but do let's knuckle under &mdash;  to our prince. Such abuse, such naked threats!  But clearly Zeus has foiled us. Or long before  we would have shut his mouth for him in the halls,  fluent and flowing as he is. &quot; </p>

<p>So he mocked. </p>

<p>Telemachus paid no heed. </p>

<p>And now through the streets  the heralds passed, leading the beasts marked out  for sacrifice on Apollo's grand festal day,  and the islanders with their long hair were filing  into the god's shady grove &mdash; ^the distant deadly Archer. </p>

<p>Those in the palace, once they'd roasted the prime cuts,  pulled them off the spits and, sharing out the portions,  fell to the royal feast ... </p>

<p>The men who served them gave Odysseus his share,  fair as the helping they received themselves.  So Telemachus ordered, the king's own son. </p>

<p>But Athena had no mind to let the brazen suitors  hold back now from their heart-rending insults &mdash;  she meant to make the anguish cut still deeper  into the core of Laertes' son Odysseus.  There was one among them, a lawless boor &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>Ctesippus was his name, he made his home in Same,  a fellow so impressed with his own astounding wealth  he courted the wife of Odysseus, gone for years.  Now the man harangued his swaggering comrades:  &quot;Listen to me, my fine friends, here's what /say!  From the start our guest has had his fair share &mdash;  it's only right, you know.  How impolite it would be, how wrong to scant  whatever guest Telemachus welcomes to his house.  Look here, I'll give him a proper guest-gift too,  a prize he can hand the crone who bathes his feet  or a tip for another slave who haunts the halls  of our great king Odysseus! &quot; </p>

<p>On that note,  grabbing an oxhoof out of a basket where it lay,  with a brawny hand he flung it straight at the king &mdash;  but Odysseus ducked his head a little, dodging the blow,  and seething just as the oxhoof hit the solid wall  he clenched his teeth in a wry sardonic grin.  Telemachus dressed Ctesippus down at once:  &quot;Ctesippus, you can thank your lucky stars  you missed our guest &mdash; he ducked your blow, by god!  Else 1 would have planted my sharp spear in your bowels &mdash;  your father would have been busy with your funeral,  not your wedding here. Enough.  Don't let me see more offenses in my house,  not from anyone! I'm alive to it all, now,  the good and the bad &mdash; ^the boy you knew is gone.  But 1 still must bear with this, this JoveJy sight ...  sheepflocks butchered, wine swilled, food squandered &mdash;  how can a man fight off so many single-handed?  But no more of your crimes against me, please!  Unless you're bent on cutting me down, now,  and I'd rather die, yes, better that by far  than have to look on at your outrage day by day:  guests treated to blows, men dragging the serving-women  through our noble house, exploiting them all, no shame!&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>Dead quiet. The suitors all fell silent, hushed.  At last Damastor's son Agelaus rose and said,  &quot;Fair enough, my friends; when a man speaks well  we have no grounds for wrangling, no cause for abuse.  Hands off this stranger! Or any other servant  in King Odysseus' palace. But now a word  of friendly advice for Telemachus and his mother &mdash;  here's hoping it proves congenial to them both.  So long as your hearts still kept a spark alive  that Odysseus would return &mdash; that great, deep man &mdash;  who could blame you, playing the waiting game at home  and holding off the suitors? The better course, it's true.  What if Odysseus Jiadreturned, had made it home at last?  But now it's clear as day &mdash; the man will come no more.  So go, Telemachus, sit with your mother, coax her  to wed the best man here, the one who offers most,  so you can have and hold your father's estate,  eating and drinking here, your mind at peace  while mother plays the wife in another's house.&quot; </p>

<p>The young prince, keeping his poise, replied,  &quot;1 swear by Zeus, Agelaus, by all my father suffered &mdash;  dead, no doubt, or wandering far from Ithaca these days &mdash;  1 don't delay my mother's marriage, not a moment,  1 press her to wed the man who takes her heart.  I'll shower her myself with boundless gifts.  But 1 shrink from driving mother from our house,  issuing harsh commands against her will.  God forbid it ever comes to tJiatf </p>

<p>So he vowed </p>

<p>and Athena set off uncontrollable laughter in the suitors,  crazed them out of their minds &mdash; mad, hysterical laughter  seemed to break from the jaws of strangers, not their own,  and the meat they were eating oozed red with blood &mdash;  tears flooded their eyes, hearts possessed by grief.  The inspired seer Theoclg menus wailed out in their midst,  &quot;Poor men, what terror is tAJsthat overwhelms you so? </p>

<p></p>

<p>Night shrouds your heads, your faces, down to your knees &mdash;  cries of mourning are bursting into fire &mdash; cheeks rivering tears &mdash;  the walls and the handsome crossbeams dripping dank with blood!  Ghosts, look, thronging the entrance, thronging the court,  go trooping down to the realm of death and darkness!  The sun is blotted out of the sky &mdash; look there &mdash;  a lethal mist spreads all across the earth! &quot; </p>

<p>At that </p>

<p>they all broke into peals of laughter aimed at the seer &mdash;  Polybus' son Eurymachus braying first and foremost,  &quot;Our guest just in from abroad, the man is raving!  Quick, my boys, hustle him out of the house,  into the meeting grounds, the light of day &mdash;  everything Aerehe thinks is dark as night!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Eurymachus,&quot; the inspired prophet countered,  &quot;when 1 want your escort, I'll ask for it myself.  1 have eyes and ears, and both my feet, still,  and a head that's fairly sound,  nothing to be ashamed of. These will do  to take me past those doors ... </p>

<p>Oh 1 can see it now &mdash;  the disaster closing on you all! There's no escaping it,  no way out &mdash; not for a single one of you suitors,  wild reckless fools, plotting outrage here,  the halls of Odysseus, great and strong as a god!&quot; </p>

<p>With that he marched out of the sturdy house  and went home to Piraeus, the host who warmed him in.  Now all the suitors, trading their snide glances, started  heckling Telemachus, made a mockery of his guests.  One or another brash young gallant scoffed,  &quot;Telemachus, no one's more unlucky with his guests!&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Look what your man dragged in &mdash; this mangy tramp  scraping for bread and wine!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Not fit for good hard work, </p>

<p>the bag of bones &mdash; &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;A useless dead weight on the land! &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;And then this charlatan up and apes the prophet.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Take it from me &mdash; you'll be better off by far &mdash;  toss your friends in a slave-ship &mdash; &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Pack them off  to Sicily, fast &mdash; they'll fetch you one sweet price!&quot; </p>

<p>So they jeered, but the prince paid no attention ...  silent, eyes riveted on his father, always waiting  the moment he'd lay hands on that outrageous mob. </p>

<p>And all the while Icarius' daughter, wise Penelope,  had placed her carved chair within earshot, at the door,  so she could catch each word they uttered in the hall.  Laughing rowdily, men prepared their noonday meal,  succulent, rich &mdash; ^they'd butchered quite a herd.  But as for supper, what could be less enticing  than what a goddess and a powerful man  would spread before them soon? A groaning feast &mdash;  for they'd been first to plot their vicious crimes. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Book XXI </p>

<p></p>

<p>Odysseus Strings  His Bow </p>

<p></p>

<p>The time had come. The goddess Athena with her blazing eyes </p>

<p>inspired Penelope, Icarius' daughter, wary, poised, </p>

<p>to set the bow and the gleaming iron axes out </p>

<p>before her suitors waiting in Odysseus' hall &mdash; </p>

<p>to test their skill and bring their slaughter on. </p>

<p>Up the steep stairs to her room she climbed </p>

<p>and grasped in a steady hand the curved key &mdash; </p>

<p>fine bronze, with ivory haft attached &mdash; </p>

<p>and then with her chamber-women made her way </p>

<p>to a hidden storeroom, far in the palace depths, </p>

<p>and there they lay, the royal master's treasures: </p>

<p>bronze, gold and a wealth of hard wrought iron </p>

<p>and there it lay as well ... his backsprung bow </p>

<p>with its quiver bristling arrows, shafts of pain. </p>

<p>Gifts from the old days, from a friend he'd met </p>

<p></p>

<p>in Lacedaemon &mdash; Iphitus, Eurytus' gallant son. </p>

<p>Once in Messene the two struck up together, </p>

<p>in sly Ortilochus' house, that time Odysseus </p>

<p>went to collect a debt the whole realm owed him, </p>

<p>for Messenian raiders had lifted flocks from Ithaca, </p>

<p>three hundred head in their oarswept ships, the herdsmen too. </p>

<p>So his father and island elders sent Odysseus off, </p>

<p>a young boy on a mission, </p>

<p>a distant embassy made to right that wrong. </p>

<p>Iphitus went there hunting the stock that Jiehad lost, </p>

<p>a dozen mares still nursing their hardy suckling mules. </p>

<p>The same mares that would prove his certain death </p>

<p>when he reached the son of Zeus, that iron heart, </p>

<p>Heracles &mdash; the past master of monstrous works &mdash; </p>

<p>who killed the man, a guest in his own house. </p>

<p>Brutal. Not a care for the wrathful eyes of god </p>

<p>or rites of hospitality he had spread before him, </p>

<p>no, he dined him, then he murdered him, commandeered </p>

<p>those hard-hoofed mares for the hero's own grange. </p>

<p>Still on the trail of these when he met Odysseus, </p>

<p>Iphitus gave him the bow his father, mighty Eurytus, </p>

<p>used to wield as a young man, but when he died </p>

<p>in his lofty house he left it to his son. </p>

<p>In turn, Odysseus gave his friend a sharp sword </p>

<p>and a rugged spear to mark the start of friendship, </p>

<p>treasured ties that bind. But before they got to know </p>

<p>the warmth of each other's board, the son of Zeus </p>

<p>had murdered Iphitus, Eurytus' magnificent son </p>

<p>who gave the prince the bow. </p>

<p>That great weapon &mdash;  King Odysseus never took it abroad with him  when he sailed off to war in his long black ships.  He kept it stored away in his stately house,  guarding the memory of a cherished friend,  and only took that bow on hunts at home. </p>

<p>Now, </p>

<p>the lustrous queen soon reached the hidden vault  and stopped at the oaken doorsill, work an expert </p>

<p></p>

<p>sanded smooth and trued to the Une some years ago, </p>

<p>planting the doorjambs snugly, hanging shining doors. </p>

<p>At once she loosed the thong from around its hook, </p>

<p>inserted the key and aiming straight and true, </p>

<p>shot back the bolts &mdash; and the rasping doors groaned </p>

<p>as loud as a bull will bellow, champing grass at pasture. </p>

<p>So as the key went home those handsome double doors </p>

<p>rang out now and sprang wide before her. </p>

<p>She stepped onto a plank where chests stood tall, </p>

<p>brimming with clothing scented sweet with cedar. </p>

<p>Reaching, tiptoe, lifting the bow down off its peg, </p>

<p>still secure in the burnished case that held it, </p>

<p>down she sank, laying the case across her knees, </p>

<p>and dissolved in tears with a high thin wail </p>

<p>as she drew her husband's weapon from its sheath ... </p>

<p>Then, having wept and sobbed to her heart's content, </p>

<p>off she went to the hall to meet her proud admirers, </p>

<p>cradling her husband's backsprung bow in her arms, </p>

<p>its quiver bristling arrows, shafts of pain. </p>

<p>Her women followed, bringing a chest that held </p>

<p>the bronze and the iron axes, trophies won by the master. </p>

<p>That radiant woman, once she reached her suitors, </p>

<p>drawing her glistening veil across her cheeks, </p>

<p>paused now where a column propped the sturdy roof, </p>

<p>with one of her loyal handmaids stationed either side, </p>

<p>and delivered an ultimatum to her suitors: </p>

<p>&quot;Listen to me, my overbearing friends! </p>

<p>You who plague this palace night and day, </p>

<p>drinking, eating us out of house and home </p>

<p>with the lord and master absent, gone so long &mdash; </p>

<p>the only excuse that you can offer is your zest </p>

<p>to win me as your bride. So, to arms, my gallants! </p>

<p>Here is the prize at issue, right before you, look &mdash; </p>

<p>1 set before you the great bow of King Odysseus now! </p>

<p>The hand that can string this bow with greatest ease, </p>

<p>that shoots an arrow clean through all twelve axes &mdash; </p>

<p>he is the man 1 follow, yes, forsaking this house </p>

<p>where 1 was once a bride, this gracious house </p>

<p></p>

<p>so filled with the best that life can offer &mdash;  1 shall always remember it, that I know ...  even in my dreams.&quot; </p>

<p>She turned to Eumaeus,  ordered the good swineherd now to set the bow  and the gleaming iron axes out before the suitors.  He broke into tears as he received them, laid them down.  The cowherd wept too, when he saw his master's bow.  But Antinous wheeled on both and let them have it:  &quot;Yokels, fools &mdash; you can't tell night from day!  You mawkish idiots, why are you sniveling here?  You're stirring up your mistress! Isn't she drowned  in grief already? She's lost her darling husband.  Sit down. Eat in peace, or take your snuffling  out of doors! But leave that bow right here &mdash;  our crucial test that makes or breaks us all.  No easy game, 1 wager, to string A75 polished bow.  Not a soul in the crowd can match Odysseus &mdash;  what a man he was ...  1 saw him once, remember him to this day,  though 1 was young and foolish way back then.&quot; </p>

<p>Smooth talk,  but deep in the suitor's heart his hopes were bent  on stringing the bow and shooting through the axes.  Antinous &mdash; fated to be the first man to taste  an arrow whipped from great Odysseus' hands,  the king he mocked, at ease in the king's house,  egging comrades on to mock him too. </p>

<p>&quot;Amazing!&quot;  Prince Telemachus waded in with a laugh:  &quot;Zeus up there has robbed me of my wits.  My own dear mother, sensible as she is,  says she'll marry again, forsake our house,  and look at /ne&mdash; laughing for all I'm worth,  giggling like some fool. Step up, my friends!  Here is the prize at issue, right before you, look &mdash;  a woman who has no equal now in all Achaean country,  neither in holy Pylos, nor in Argos or Mycenae, </p>

<p></p>

<p>not even Ithaca itself or the loamy mainland. </p>

<p>You know it well. Why sing my mother 's praises? </p>

<p>Come, let the games begin! No dodges, no delays, </p>

<p>no turning back from the stringing of the bow &mdash; </p>

<p>we'll see who wins, we will. </p>

<p>I'd even take a crack at the bow myself ... </p>

<p>If 1 string it and shoot through all the axes, </p>

<p>I'd worry less if my noble mother left our house </p>

<p>with another man and left me here behind &mdash; man enough </p>

<p>at last to win my father's splendid prizes!&quot; </p>

<p>With that </p>

<p>he leapt to his feet and dropped his bright red cloak, </p>

<p>slipping the sword and sword-belt off his shoulders. </p>

<p>First he planted the axes, digging a long trench, </p>

<p>one for all, and trued them all to a line, </p>

<p>then tamped the earth to bed them. Wonder took </p>

<p>the revelers looking on: his work so firm, precise, </p>

<p>though he'd never seen the axes ranged before. </p>

<p>He stood at the threshold, poised to try the bow ... </p>

<p>Three times he made it shudder, straining to bend it, </p>

<p>three times his power flagged &mdash; but his hopes ran high </p>

<p>he'd string his father's bow and shoot through every iron </p>

<p>and now, struggling with all his might for the fourth time, </p>

<p>he wouJdhave strung the bow, but Odysseus shook his head </p>

<p>and stopped him short despite his tensing zeal. </p>

<p>&quot;God help me,&quot; the inspired prince cried out, </p>

<p>&quot;must 1 be a weakling, a failure all my life? </p>

<p>Unless I'm just too young to trust my hands </p>

<p>to fight off any man who rises up against me. </p>

<p>Come, my betters, so much stronger than /am &mdash; </p>

<p>try the bow and finish off the contest.&quot; </p>

<p>He propped his father's weapon on the ground,  tilting it up against the polished well-hung doors  and resting a shaft aslant the bow's fine horn,  then back he went to the seat that he had left.  &quot;Up, friends!&quot; Antinous called, taking over.  &quot;One man after another, left to right. </p>

<p></p>

<p>starting from where the steward pours the wine. &quot; </p>

<p>So Antinous urged and all agreed.  The first man up was Leodes, Oenops' son,  a seer who could see their futures in the smoke,  who always sat by the glowing winebowl, well back,  the one man in the group who loathed their reckless ways,  appalled by all their outrage. His turn first ...  Picking up the weapon now and the swift arrow,  he stood at the threshold, poised to try the bow  but failed to bend it. As soon as he tugged the string  his hands went slack, his soft, uncallused hands,  and he called back to the suitors, &quot;Friends,  /can't bend it. Take it, someone &mdash; try.  Here is a bow to rob our best of life and breath,  all our best contenders! Still, better be dead  than live on here, never winning the prize  that tempts us all &mdash; forever in pursuit,  burning with expectation every day.  If there's still a suitor here who hopes,  who aches to marry Penelope, Odysseus' wife,  just let him try the bow; he'll see the truth!  He'll soon lay siege to another Argive woman  trailing her long robes, and shower her with gifts &mdash;  and then our queen can marry the one who offers most,  the man marked out by fate to be her husband. &quot; </p>

<p>With those words he thrust the bow aside,  tilting it up against the polished well-hung doors  and resting a shaft aslant the bow's fine horn,  then back he went to the seat that he had left.  But Antinous turned on the seer, abuses flying:  &quot;Leodes! what are you saying? what's got past your lips?  What awful, grisly nonsense &mdash; it shocks me to hear it &mdash;  'here is a bow to rob our best of life and breath!'  Just because can't string it, you're, so weak?  Clearly your genteel mother never bred her boy  for the work of bending bows and shooting arrows. </p>

<p></p>

<p>We have champions in our ranks to string it quickly. </p>

<p>Hop to it, Melanthius!&quot; &mdash; he barked at the goatherd &mdash; </p>

<p>&quot;Rake the fire in the hall, pull up a big stool, </p>

<p>heap it with fleece and fetch that hefty ball </p>

<p>of lard from the stores inside. So we young lords </p>

<p>can heat and limber the bow and rub it down with grease </p>

<p>before we try again and finish off the contest!&quot; </p>

<p>The goatherd bustled about to rake the fire  still going strong. He pulled up a big stool,  heaped it with fleece and fetched the hefty ball  of lard from the stores inside. And the young men  limbered the bow, rubbing it down with hot grease,  then struggled to bend it back but failed. No use &mdash;  they fell far short of the strength the bow required.  Antinous still held off, dashing Eurymachus too,  the ringleaders of all the suitors,  head and shoulders the strongest of the lot. </p>

<p>But now </p>

<p>the king's two men, the cowherd and the swineherd,  had slipped out of the palace side-by-side  and great Odysseus left the house to join them.  Once they were past the courtyard and the gates  he probed them deftly, surely: &quot;Cowherd, swineherd,  what, shall 1 blurt this out or keep it to myself?  No, speak out. The heart inside me says so.  How far would you go to fight beside Odysseus?  Say he dropped like tJiat from a clear blue sky  and a god brought him back &mdash;  would you fight for the suitors or your king?  Tell me how you feel inside your hearts.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Father Zeus,&quot; the trusty cowherd shouted,  &quot;bring my prayer to pass! Let the master come &mdash;  some god guide him now! You'd see my power,  my fighting arms in action!&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>Eumaeus echoed his prayer to all the gods  that their wise king would soon come home again.  Certain at least these two were loyal to the death,  Odysseus reassured them quickly: &quot;I'm right here,  here in the flesh &mdash; myself &mdash; and home at last,  after bearing twenty years of brutal hardship.  Now 1 know that of all my men you two alone  longed for my return. From the rest I've heard  not one real prayer that 1 come back again.  So now I'll tell you what's in store for you.  If a god beats down the lofty suitors at my hands,  I'll find you wives, both of you, grant you property,  sturdy houses beside my own, and in my eyes you'll be  comrades to Prince Telemachus, brothers from then on.  Come, I'll show you something &mdash; living proof &mdash;  know me for certain, put your minds at rest. </p>

<p>This scar, </p>

<p>look, where a boar's white tusk gored me, years ago,  hunting on Parnassus, Autolycus' sons and 1. ' </p>

<p>With that, </p>

<p>pushing back his rags, he revealed the great scar ... </p>

<p>And the men gazed at it, scanned it, knew it well, </p>

<p>broke into tears and threw their arms around their master &mdash; </p>

<p>lost in affection, kissing his head and shoulders, </p>

<p>and so Odysseus kissed their heads and hands. </p>

<p>Now the sun would have set upon their tears </p>

<p>if Odysseus had not called a halt himself. </p>

<p>&quot;No more weeping. Coming out of the house </p>

<p>a man might see us, tell the men inside. </p>

<p>Let's slip back in &mdash; singly, not in a pack. </p>

<p>I'll go first. You're next. Here's our signal. </p>

<p>When all the rest in there, our lordly friends, </p>

<p>are dead against my having the bow and quiver, </p>

<p>good Eumaeus, carry the weapon down the hall </p>

<p>and put it in my hands. Then tell the serving-women </p>

<p>to lock the snugly fitted doors to their own rooms. </p>

<p>If anyone hears from there the jolting blows </p>

<p>and groans of men, caught in our huge net, </p>

<p>not one of them show her face &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>sit tight, keep to her weaving, not a sound.  You, my good Philoetius, here are your orders.  Shoot the bolt of the courtyard's outer gate,  lock it, lash it fast.&quot; </p>

<p>With that command  the master entered his well-constructed house  and back he went to the stool that he had left.  The king's two men, in turn, slipped in as well. </p>

<p>Just now Eurymachus held the bow in his hands,  turning it over, tip to tip, before the blazing fire  to heat the weapon. But he failed to bend it even so  and the suitor's high heart groaned to bursting.  &quot;A black day , &quot; he exclaimed in wounded pride,  &quot;a blow to myself, a blow to each man here!  It's less the marriage that mortifies me now &mdash;  that's galling too, but lots of women are left,  some in seagirt Ithaca, some in other cities.  What breaks my heart is the fact we fall so short  of great Odysseus' strength we cannot string his bow.  A disgrace to ring in the ears of men to come.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Eurymachus,&quot; Eupithes' son Antinous countered,  &quot;it will never come to that, as you well know.  Today is a feast-day up and down the island  in honor of the Archer God. Who flexes bows today?  Set it aside. Rest easy now. And all the axes,  let's just leave them planted where they are.  Trust me, no one's about to crash the gates  of Laertes' son and carry off these trophies.  Steward, pour some drops for the god in every cup,  we'll tip the wine, then put the bow to bed.  And first thing in the morning have Melanthius  bring the pick of his goats from all his herds  so we can burn the thighs to Apollo, god of archers &mdash;  then try the bow and finish off the contest.&quot; </p>

<p>Welcome advice. And again they all agreed. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Heralds sprinkled water over their hands for rinsing,  the young men brimmed the mixing bowls with wine,  they tipped first drops for the god in every cup,  then poured full rounds for all. And now, once  they'd tipped libations out and drunk their fill,  the king of craft, Odysseus, said with all his cunning,  &quot;Listen to me, you lords who court the noble queen.  1 have to say what the heart inside me urges.  1 appeal especially to Eurymachus, and you,  brilliant Antinous, who spoke so shrewdly now.  Give the bow a rest for today, leave it to the gods &mdash;  at dawn the Archer God will grant a victory  to the man he favors most. </p>

<p>For the moment,  give me the polished bow now, won't you? So,  to amuse you all, 1 can try my hand, my strength ...  is the old force still alive inside these gnarled limbs?  Or has a life of roaming, years of rough neglect,  destroyed it long ago?&quot; </p>

<p>Modest words  that sent them all into hot, indignant rage,  fearing he just might string the polished bow.  So Antinous rounded on him, dressed him down:  &quot;Not a shred of sense in your head, you filthy drifter!  Not content to feast at your ease with us, the island's pride?  Never denied your full share of the banquet, never,  you can listen in on our secrets. No one else  can eavesdrop on our talk, no tramp, no beggar.  The wine has overpowered you, heady wine &mdash;  the ruin of many another man, whoever  gulps it down and drinks beyond his limit.  Wine &mdash; it drove the Centaur, famous Eurytion,  mad in the halls of lionhearted Pirithous.  There to visit the Lapiths, crazed with wine  the headlong Centaur bent to his ugly work  in the prince's own house! His hosts sprang up,  seized with fury, dragged him across the forecourt,  flung him out of doors, hacking his nose and ears off </p>

<p></p>

<p>with their knives, no mercy. The creature reeled away,  still blind with drink, his heart like a wild storm,  loaded with all the frenzy in his mind! </p>

<p>And so </p>

<p>the feud between mortal men and Centaurs had its start. </p>

<p>But the drunk was first to bring disaster on himself </p>

<p>by drowning in his cups. You too, 1 promise you </p>

<p>no end of trouble if you should string that bow. </p>

<p>You'll meet no kindness in our part of the world &mdash; </p>

<p>we'll sail you off in a black ship to Echetus, </p>

<p>the mainland king who wrecks all men alive. </p>

<p>Nothing can save you from his royal grip! </p>

<p>So drink, but hold your peace, </p>

<p>don't take on the younger, stronger men. &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Antinous, &quot; watchful Penelope stepped in,  &quot;how impolite it would be, how wrong, to scant  whatever guest Telemachus welcomes to his house.  You really think &mdash; if the stranger trusts so to his hands  and strength that he strings Odysseus' great bow &mdash;  he'll take me home and claim me as his bride?  /fe never dreamed of such a thing, I'm sure.  Don't let that ruin the feast for any reveler here.  Unthinkable &mdash; nothing, nothing could be worse.&quot; </p>

<p>Polybus' son Eurymachus had an answer:  &quot;Wise Penelope, daughter of Icarius, do we really  expect the man to wed you? Unthinkable, 1 know.  But we do recoil at the talk of men and women.  One of the island's meaner sort will mutter,  'Look at the riffraff courting a king's wife.  Weaklings, look, they can't even string his bow.  But along came this beggar, drifting out of the blue &mdash;  strung his bow with ease and shot through all the axes!'  Gossip will fly. We'll hang our heads in shame.&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Shame?' alert Penelope protested &mdash;  &quot;How can you hope for any public fame at all?  You who disgrace, devour a great man's house and home!  Why hang your heads in shame over next to nothing?  Our friend here is a strapping, well-built man  and claims to be the son of a noble father.  Come, hand him the bow now, let's just see ...  1 tell you this &mdash; and I'll make good my word &mdash;  if he strings the bow and Apollo grants him glory,  I'll dress him in shirt and cloak, in handsome clothes,  I'll give him a good sharp lance to fight off men and dogs,  give him a two-edged sword and sandals for his feet  and send him off, wherever his heart desires.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Mother,&quot; </p>

<p>poised Telemachus broke in now, &quot;my father's bow &mdash; </p>

<p>no Achaean on earth has more right than 1 </p>

<p>to give it or withhold it, as 1 please. </p>

<p>Of all the lords in Ithaca's rocky heights </p>

<p>or the islands facing Elis grazed by horses, </p>

<p>not a single one will force or thwart my will, </p>

<p>even if 1 decide to give our guest \Ms bow &mdash; </p>

<p>a gift outright &mdash; to carry off himself. </p>

<p>So, mother, </p>

<p>go back to your quarters. Tend to your own tasks,  the distaff and the loom, and keep the women  working hard as well. As for the bow now,  men will see to that, but 1 most of all:  /hold the reins of power in this house. &quot; </p>

<p>Astonished, </p>

<p>she withdrew to her own room. She took to heart  the clear good sense in what her son had said.  Climbing up to the lofty chamber with her women,  she fell to weeping for Odysseus, her beloved husband,  till watchful Athena sealed her eyes with welcome sleep. </p>

<p></p>

<p>And now the loyal swineherd had lifted up the bow,  was taking it toward the king, when all the suitors  burst out in an ugly uproar through the palace &mdash;  brash young bullies, this or that one heckling,  &quot;Where on earth are you going with that bow?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You, you grubby swineherd, are you crazy?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The speedy dogs you reared will eat your corpse &mdash; &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Out there with your pigs, out in the cold, alone!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;If only Apollo and all the gods shine down on us!' </p>

<p>Eumaeus froze in his tracks, put down the bow,  panicked by every outcry in the hall.  Telemachus shouted too, from the other side,  and full of threats: &quot;Carry on with the bow, old boy!  If you serve too many masters, you'll soon suffer.  Look sharp, or I'll pelt you back to your farm  with flying rocks. 1 may be younger than you  but I'm much stronger. If only 1 had that edge  in fists and brawn over all this courting crowd,  I'd soon dispatch them &mdash; licking their wounds at last &mdash;  clear of our palace where they plot their vicious plots!&quot; </p>

<p>His outburst sent them all into gales of laughter,  blithe and oblivious, that dissolved their pique  against the prince. The swineherd took the bow,  carried it down the hall to his ready, waiting king  and standing by him, placed it in his hands,  then he called the nurse aside and whispered,  &quot;Good Eurycleia &mdash; ^Telemachus commands you now  to lock the snugly fitted doors to your own rooms.  If anyone hears from there the jolting blows  and groans of men, caught in our huge net,  not one of you show your face &mdash;  sit tight, keep to your weaving, not a sound. &quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>That silenced the old nurse &mdash;  she barred the doors that led from the long hall.  The cowherd quietly bounded out of the house  to lock the gates of the high-stockaded court.  Under the portico lay a cable, ship's tough gear:  he lashed the gates with this, then slipped back in  and ran and sat on the stool that he'd just left,  eyes riveted on Odysseus. </p>

<p>Now heheld the bow  in his own hands, turning it over, tip to tip,  testing it, this way, that way ... fearing worms  had bored through the weapon's horn with the master gone abroad.  A suitor would glance at his neighbor, jeering, taunting,  &quot;Look at our connoisseur of bows! &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Sly old fox-  maybe he's got bows like it, stored in Az? house.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;That or he's bent on making one himself.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Look how he twists and turns it in his hands!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The clever tramp means trouble &mdash; &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;1 wish him luck,&quot; some cocksure lord chimed in,  &quot;as good as his luck in bending back that weapon!&quot; </p>

<p>So they mocked, but Odysseus, mastermind in action,  once he'd handled the great bow and scanned every inch,  then, like an expert singer skilled at lyre and song &mdash;  who strains a string to a new peg with ease,  making the pliant sheep-gut fast at either end &mdash;  so with his virtuoso ease Odysseus strung his mighty bow.  Quickly his right hand plucked the string to test its pitch  and under his touch it sang out clear and sharp as a swallow's cry.  Horror swept through the suitors, faces blanching white,  and Zeus cracked the sky with a bolt, his blazing sign,  and the great man who had borne so much rejoiced at last  that the son of cunning Cronus flung that omen down for him. </p>

<p></p>

<p>He snatched a winged arrow lying bare on the board &mdash;  the rest still bristled deep inside the quiver,  soon to be tasted by all the feasters there.  Setting shaft on the handgrip, drawing the notch  and bowstring back, back ... right from his stool,  just as he sat but aiming straight and true, he let fly &mdash;  and never missing an ax from the first ax-handle  clean on through to the last and out  the shaft with its weighted brazen head shot free! </p>

<p>&quot;My son,&quot; </p>

<p>Odysseus looked to Telemachus and said, &quot;your guest,  sitting here in your house, has not disgraced you.  No missing the mark, look, and no long labor spent  to string the bow. My strength's not broken yet,  not quite so frail as the mocking suitors thought.  But the hour has come to serve our masters right &mdash;  supper in broad daylight &mdash; then to other revels,  song and dancing, all that crowns a feast.&quot; </p>

<p>He paused with a warning nod, and at that sign  Prince Telemachus, son of King Odysseus,  girding his sharp sword on, clamping hand to spear,  took his stand by a chair that flanked his father &mdash;  his bronze spearpoint glinting now like fire ... </p>

<p></p>

<p>Book XXII </p>

<p></p>

<p>Slaughter in  the Hall </p>

<p></p>

<p>Now stripping back his rags Odysseus master of craft and battle  vaulted onto the great threshold, gripping his bow and quiver  bristling arrows, and poured his flashing shafts before him,  loose at his feet, and thundered out to all the suitors:  &quot;Look &mdash; your crucial test is finished, now, at last!  But another target's left that no one's hit before &mdash;  we'll see if /can hit it &mdash; ^Apollo give me glory!&quot; </p>

<p>With that he trained a stabbing arrow on Antinous ...  just lifting a gorgeous golden loving-cup in his hands,  just tilting the two-handled goblet back to his lips,  about to drain the wine &mdash; and slaughter the last thing  on the suitor's mind: who could dream that one foe  in that crowd of feasters, however great his power,  would bring down death on himself, and black doom? </p>

<p></p>

<p>But Odysseus aimed and shot Antinous square in the throat  and the point went stabbing clean through the soft neck and out &mdash;  and off to the side he pitched, the cup dropped from his grasp  as the shaft sank home, and the man's life-blood came spurting  out his nostrils &mdash; </p>

<p>thick red jets &mdash; </p>

<p>a sudden thrust of his foot &mdash; </p>

<p>he kicked away the table &mdash; </p>

<p>food showered across the floor,  the bread and meats soaked in a swirl of bloody filth.  The suitors burst into uproar all throughout the house  when they saw their leader down. They leapt from their seats,  milling about, desperate, scanning the stone walls &mdash;  not a shield in sight, no rugged spear to seize.  They wheeled on Odysseus, lashing out in fury:  &quot;Stranger, shooting at men will cost your life!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Your game is over &mdash; you, you've shot your last!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You'll never escape your own headlong death!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You killed the best in Ithaca &mdash; our fine prince!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Vultures will eat your corpse!&quot; </p>

<p>Groping, frantic &mdash;  each one persuading himself the guest had killed  the man by chance. Poor fools, blind to the fact  that all their necks were in the noose, their doom sealed.  With a dark look, the wily fighter Odysseus shouted back,  &quot;You dogs! you never imagined I'd return from Troy &mdash;  so cocksure that you bled my house to death,  ravished my serving-women &mdash; ^wooed my wife  behind my back while 1 was still alive!  No fear of the gods who rule the skies up there,  no fear that men's revenge might arrive someday &mdash;  now all your necks are in the noose &mdash; your doom is sealed!&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>Terror gripped them all, blanched their faces white,  each man glancing wildly &mdash; how to escape his instant death?  Only Eurymachus had the breath to venture, &quot;If you,  you're truly Odysseus of Ithaca, home at last,  you're right to accuse these men of what they've done &mdash;  so much reckless outrage here in your palace,  so much on your lands. But here he lies,  quite dead, and he incited it all &mdash; ^Antinous &mdash;  look, the man who drove us all to crime!  Not that he needed marriage, craved it so;  he'd bigger game in mind &mdash; though Zeus barred his way &mdash;  he'd lord it over Ithaca's handsome country, king himself,  once he'd lain in wait for your son and cut him down!  But now he's received the death that he deserved.  So spare your own people! Later we'll recoup  your costs with a tax laid down upon the land,  covering all we ate and drank inside your halls,  and each of us here will pay full measure too &mdash;  twenty oxen in value, bronze and gold we'll give  until we melt your heart. Before we've settled,  who on earth could blame you for your rage?&quot; </p>

<p>But the battle-master kept on glaring, seething.  &quot;No, Eurymachus! Not if you paid me all your father's wealth &mdash;  all you possess now, and all that could pour in from the world's end &mdash;  no, not even then would 1 stay my hands from slaughter  till all you suitors had paid for all your crimes!  Now life or death &mdash; your choice &mdash; fight me or flee  if you hope to escape your sudden bloody doom!  1 doubt one man in the lot will save his skin!&quot; </p>

<p>His menace shook their knees, their hearts too  but Eurymachus spoke again, now to the suitors: &quot;Friends!  This man will never restrain his hands, invincible hands &mdash;  now that he's seized that polished bow and quiver, look,  he'll shoot from the sill until he's killed us all!  So fight &mdash; call up the joy of battle! Swords out!  Tables lifted &mdash; block his arrows winging death!  Charge him, charge in a pack &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>try to rout the man from the sill, the doors,  race through town and sound an alarm at once &mdash;  our friend would soon see he's shot his bolt!&quot; </p>

<p>Brave talk &mdash; </p>

<p>he drew his two-edged sword, bronze, honed for the kill  and hurled himself at the king with a raw savage cry  in the same breath that Odysseus loosed an arrow  ripping his breast beside the nipple so hard  it lodged in the man's liver &mdash;  Out of his grasp the sword dropped to the ground &mdash;  over his table, head over heels he tumbled, doubled up,  flinging his food and his two-handled cup across the floor &mdash;  he smashed the ground with his forehead, writhing in pain,  both feet flailing out, and his high seat tottered &mdash;  the mist of death came swirling down his eyes. </p>

<p>Amphinomus rushed the king in all his glory,  charging him face-to-face, a slashing sword drawn &mdash;  if only he could force him clear of the doorway, now,  but Telemachus &mdash; too quick &mdash; stabbed the man from behind,  plunging his bronze spear between the suitor's shoulders  and straight on through his chest the point came jutting out &mdash;  down he went with a thud, his forehead slammed the ground.  Telemachus swerved aside, leaving his long spearshaft  lodged in Amphinomus &mdash; fearing some suitor just might  lunge in from behind as he tugged the shaft,  impale him with a sword or hack him down,  crouching over the corpse.  He went on the run, reached his father at once  and halting right beside him, let fly, &quot;Father &mdash;  now I'll get you a shield and a pair of spears,  a helmet of solid bronze to fit your temples!  I'll arm myself on the way back and hand out  arms to the swineherd, arm the cowherd too &mdash;  we'd better fight equipped!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Run, fetch them,&quot;  the wily captain urged, &quot;while I've got arrows left  to defend me &mdash; or they 'll force me from the doors  while 1 fight on alone!&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>Telemachus moved to his father's orders smartly.  Off he ran to the room where the famous arms lay stored,  took up four shields, eight spears, four bronze helmets  ridged with horsehair crests and, loaded with these,  ran back to reach his father's side in no time.  The prince was first to case himself in bronze  and his servants followed suit &mdash; both harnessed up  and all three flanked Odysseus, mastermind of war,  and he, as long as he'd arrows left to defend himself,  kept picking suitors off in the palace, one by one  and down they went, corpse on corpse in droves.  Then, when the royal archer's shafts ran out,  he leaned his bow on a post of the massive doors &mdash;  where walls of the hallway catch the light &mdash; and armed:  across his shoulder he slung a buckler four plies thick,  over his powerful head he set a well-forged helmet,  the horsehair crest atop it tossing, bristling terror,  and grasped two rugged lances tipped with fiery bronze. </p>

<p>Now a side-door was fitted into the main wall &mdash;  right at the edge of the great hall's stone sill &mdash;  and led to a passage always shut by good tight boards.  But Odysseus gave the swineherd strict commands  to stand hard by the side-door, guard it well &mdash;  the only way the suitors might break out.  Agelaus called to his comrades with a plan:  &quot;Friends, can't someone climb through the hatch? &mdash;  tell men outside to sound the alarm, be quick &mdash;  our guest would soon see he'd shot his last!&quot; </p>

<p>The goatherd Melanthius answered, &quot;Not a chance,  my lord &mdash; the door to the courtyard's much too near,  dangerous too, the mouth of the passage cramped.  One strong man could block us, one and all!  No, I'll fetch you some armor to harness on,  out of the storeroom &mdash; ^there, nowhere else, I'm sure,  the king and his gallant son have stowed their arms!&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>With that the goatherd clambered up through smoke-ducts  high on the wall arid scurried into Odysseus' storeroom,  bundled a dozen shields, as many spears and helmets  ridged with horsehair crests and, loaded with these,  rushed back down to the suitors, quickly issued arms.  Odysseus' knees shook, his heart too, when he saw them  buckling on their armor, brandishing long spears &mdash;  here was a battle looming, well he knew.  He turned at once to Telemachus, warnings flying:  &quot;A bad break in the fight, my boy! One of the women's  tipped the odds against us &mdash; or could it be the goatherd? &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;My fault, father,&quot; the cool clear prince replied,  &quot;the blame's all mine. That snug door to the vault,  1 left it ajar &mdash; they've kept a better watch than 1.  Go, Eumaeus, shut the door to the storeroom,  check and see if it's one of the women's tricks  or Dolius' son Melanthius. He's our man, I'd say.&quot; </p>

<p>And even as they conspired, back the goatherd  climbed to the room to fetch more burnished arms,  but Eumaeus spotted him, quickly told his king  who stood close by: &quot;Odysseus, wily captain,  there he goes again, the infernal nuisance &mdash;  just as we suspected &mdash; back to the storeroom.  Give me a clear command!  Do 1 kill the man &mdash; if 1 can take him down &mdash;  or drag him back to you, here, to pay in full  for the dirty work he's plotted in your house?&quot; </p>

<p>Odysseus, master of tactics, answered briskly,  &quot;1 and the prince will keep these brazen suitors  crammed in the hall, for all their battle-fury.  You two wrench Melanthius' arms and legs behind him,  fling him down in the storeroom &mdash; lash his back to a plank  and strap a twisted cable fast to the scoundrel's body, </p>

<p></p>

<p>hoist him up a column until he hits the rafters &mdash;  let him dangle in agony, still alive,  for a good long time!&quot; </p>

<p>They hung on his orders, keen to do his will.  Off they ran to the storeroom, unseen by him inside &mdash;  Melanthius, rummaging after arms, deep in a dark recess  as the two men took their stand, either side the doorposts,  poised till the goatherd tried to cross the doorsill ...  one hand clutching a crested helmet, the other  an ample old buckler blotched with mildew,  the shield Laertes bore as a young soldier once &mdash;  but there it lay for ages, seams on the handstraps split &mdash;  Quick, they rushed him, seized him, haled him back by the hair,  flung him down on the floor, writhing with terror, bound him  hand and foot with a chafing cord, wrenched his limbs  back, back till the joints locked tight &mdash;  just as Laertes' cunning son commanded &mdash;  they strapped a twisted cable round his body,  hoisted him up a column until he hit the rafters,  then you mocked him, Eumaeus, my good swineherd:  &quot;Now stand guard through the whole night, Melanthius &mdash;  stretched out on a soft bed fit for you, your highness!  You're bound to see the Morning rising up from the Ocean,  mounting her golden throne &mdash; at just the hour you always  drive in goats to feast the suitors in the hall!&quot; </p>

<p>So they left him, trussed in his agonizing sling;  they clapped on armor again, shut the gleaming doors  and ran to rejoin Odysseus, mastermind of war.  And now as the ranks squared off, breathing fury &mdash;  four at the sill confronting a larger, stronger force  arrayed inside the hall &mdash; now Zeus's daughter Athena,  taking the build and voice of Mentor, swept in  and Odysseus, thrilled to see her, cried out,  &quot;Rescue us. Mentor, now it's life or death! </p>

<p></p>

<p>Remember your old comrade &mdash; all the service  1 offered you/ We were boys together!&quot; </p>

<p>So he cried </p>

<p>yet knew in his bones it was Athena, Driver of Armies. </p>

<p>But across the hall the suitors brayed against her, </p>

<p>Agelaus first, his outburst full of threats: </p>

<p>&quot;Mentor, never let Odysseus trick you into </p>

<p>siding with Jii'mio fight against the suitors. </p>

<p>Here's our plan of action, and we will see it through! </p>

<p>Once we've killed them both, the father and the son, </p>

<p>we'll kill you too, for all you're bent on doing </p>

<p>here in the halls &mdash; you'll pay with your own head! </p>

<p>And once our swords have stopped your violence cold &mdash; </p>

<p>all your property, all in your house, your fields, </p>

<p>we'll lump it all with Odysseus' rich estate </p>

<p>and never let your sons live on in your halls </p>

<p>or free your wife and daughters to walk through town!&quot; </p>

<p>Naked threats &mdash; and Athena hit new heights of rage,  she lashed out at Odysseus now with blazing accusations:  &quot;Where's it gone, Odysseus &mdash; your power, your fighting heart?  The great soldier who fought for famous white-armed Helen,  battling Trojans nine long years &mdash; nonstop, no mercy,  mowing their armies down in grueling battle &mdash;  you who seized the broad streets of Troy  with your fine strategic stroke! How can you &mdash;  now you've returned to your own house, your own wealth &mdash;  bewail the loss of your combat strength in a war with suitors?  Come, old friend, stand by me! You'll see action now,  see how Mentor the son of Alcimus, that brave fighter,  kills your enemies, pays you back for service!&quot; </p>

<p>Rousing words &mdash;  but she gave no all-out turning of the tide, not yet,  she kept on testing Odysseus and his gallant son,  putting their force and fighting heart to proof.  For all the world like a swallow in their sight  she flew on high to perch </p>

<p>on the great hall's central roof beam black with smoke. </p>

<p></p>

<p>But the suitors closed ranks, commanded now by Damastor's </p>

<p>sonAgelaus, flanked by Eurynomus, Demoptolemus and Amphimedon, </p>

<p>Pisander, Polyctor's son, and Poly bus ready, waiting &mdash; </p>

<p>head and shoulders the best and bravest of the lot </p>

<p>still left to fight for their lives, </p>

<p>now that the pelting shafts had killed the rest. </p>

<p>Agelaus spurred his comrades on with battle-plans: </p>

<p>&quot;Friends, at last the man's invincible hands are useless! </p>

<p>Mentor has mouthed some empty boasts and flitted off &mdash; </p>

<p>just four are left to fight at the front doors. So now, </p>

<p>no wasting your long spears &mdash; all at a single hurl, </p>

<p>just six of us launch out in the first wave! </p>

<p>If Zeus is willing, we may hit Odysseus, </p>

<p>carry off the glory! The rest are nothing </p>

<p>once the captain's down!&quot; </p>

<p>At his command,  concentrating their shots, all six hurled as one  but Athena sent the whole salvo wide of the mark &mdash;  one of them hit the jamb of the great hall's doors,  another the massive door itself, and the heavy bronze point  of a third ashen javelin crashed against the wall.  Seeing his men untouched by the suitors' flurry,  steady Odysseus leapt to take command:  &quot;Friends! now it's for usto hurl at them, 1 say,  into this ruck of suitors! Topping all their crimes  they're mad to strip the armor off our bodies!&quot; </p>

<p>Taking aim at the ranks, all four let fly as one  and the lances struck home &mdash; Odysseus killed Demoptolemus,  Telemachus killed Euryades &mdash; the swineherd. Flatus &mdash;  and the cowherd cut Pisander down in blood.  They bit the dust of the broad floor, all as one.  Back to the great hall's far recess the others shrank  as the four rushed in and plucked up spears from corpses. </p>

<p>And again the suitors hurled their whetted shafts  but Athena sent the better part of the salvo wide &mdash;  one of them hit the jamb of the great hall's doors,  another the massive door itself, and the heavy bronze point </p>

<p></p>

<p>of a third ashen javelin crashed against the wall. </p>

<p>True, Amphimedon nicked Telemachus on the wrist &mdash; </p>

<p>the glancing blade just barely broke his skin. </p>

<p>Ctesippus sent a long spear sailing over </p>

<p>Eumaeus' buckler, grazing his shoulder blade </p>

<p>but the weapon skittered off and hit the ground. </p>

<p>And again those led by the brilliant battle-master </p>

<p>hurled their razor spears at the suitors' ranks &mdash; </p>

<p>and now Odysseus raider of cities hit Eurydamas, </p>

<p>Telemachus hit Amphimedon &mdash; Eumaeus, Poly bus &mdash; </p>

<p>and the cowherd stabbed Ctesippus </p>

<p>right in the man's chest and triumphed over his body: </p>

<p>&quot;Love your mockery, do you? Son of that blowhard Polytherses! </p>

<p>No more shooting off your mouth, you idiot, such big talk &mdash; </p>

<p>leave the last word to the gods &mdash; they're much stronger! </p>

<p>Take this spear, this guest-gift, for the cow's hoof </p>

<p>you once gave King Odysseus begging in his house!&quot; </p>

<p>So the master of longhorn cattle had his say &mdash;  as Odysseus, fighting at close quarters, ran Agelaus  through with a long lance &mdash; ^Telemachus speared Leocritus  so deep in the groin the bronze came punching out his back  and the man crashed headfirst, slamming the ground full-face.  And now Athena, looming out of the rafters high above them,  brandished her man-destroying shield of thunder, terrifying  the suitors out of their minds, and down the hall they panicked &mdash;  wild, like herds stampeding, driven mad as the darting gadfly  strikes in the late spring when the long days come round.  The attackers struck like eagles, crook-clawed, hook-beaked,  swooping down from a mountain ridge to harry smaller birds  that skim across the flatland, cringing under the clouds  but the eagles plunge in fury, rip their lives out &mdash; hopeless,  never a chance of flight or rescue &mdash; and people love the sport &mdash;  so the attackers routed suitors headlong down the hall,  wheeling into the slaughter, slashing left and right  and grisly screams broke from skulls cracked open &mdash;  the whole floor awash with blood. </p>

<p>Leodes now &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>he flung himself at Odysseus, clutched his knees,  crying out to the king with a sudden, winging prayer:  &quot;1 hug your knees, Odysseus &mdash; mercy! spare my life!  Never, 1 swear, did 1 harass any woman in your house &mdash;  never a word, a gesture &mdash; nothing, no, 1 tried  to restrain the suitors, whoever did such things.  They wouldn't listen, keep their hands to themselves &mdash;  so reckless, so they earn their shameful fate.  But 1 was just their prophet &mdash;  /72Z/ hands are clean &mdash; and I'm to die their death!  Look at the thanks 1 get for years of service! &quot; </p>

<p>A killing look, and the wry soldier answered,  &quot;Only a priest, a prophet for this mob, you say?  How hard you must have prayed in my own house  that the heady day of my return would never dawn &mdash;  my dear wife would be yours, would bear your children!  For ^Aa^there's no escape from grueling death &mdash; you die!&quot; </p>

<p>And snatching up in one powerful hand a sword  left on the ground &mdash; ^Agelaus dropped it when he fell &mdash;  Odysseus hacked the prophet square across the neck  and the praying head went tumbling in the dust. </p>

<p>Now one was left,  trying still to escape black death. Phemius, Terpis' son,  the bard who always performed among the suitors &mdash;  they forced the man to sing ...  There he stood, backing into the side-door,  still clutching his ringing lyre in his hands,  his mind in turmoil, torn &mdash; ^what should he do now?  Steal from the hall and crouch at the altar-stone  of Zeus who Guards the Court, where time and again  Odysseus and Laertes burned the long thighs of oxen?  Or throw himself on the master's mercy, clasp his knees?  That was the better way &mdash; or so it struck him, yes,  grasp the knees of Laertes' royal son. And so,  cradling his hollow lyre, he laid it on the ground  between the mixing-bowl and the silver-studded throne. </p>

<p></p>

<p>then rushed up to Odysseus, yes, and clutched his knees,  singing out to his king with a stirring, winged prayer:  &quot;I hug your knees, Odysseus &mdash; mercy! spare my life!  What a grief it will be to you for all the years to come  if you kill the singer now, who sings for gods and men.  1 taught myself the craft, but a god has planted  deep in my spirit all the paths of song &mdash;  songs I'm fit to sing for you as for a god.  Calm your bloodlust now &mdash; don't take my head!  He'd bear me out, your own dear son Telemachus &mdash;  never of /72z/own will, never for any gain did 1  perform in your house, singing after the suitors  had their feasts. They were too strong, too many &mdash;  they forced me to come and sing &mdash; 1 had no choice! &quot; </p>

<p>The inspired Prince Telemachus heard his pleas  and quickly said to his father close beside him,  &quot;Stop, don't cut him down! This one's innocent.  So is the herald Medon &mdash; the one who always  tended me in the house when 1 was little &mdash;  spare him too. Unless he's dead by now,  killed by Philoetius or Eumaeus here &mdash;  or ran into f/f7f/ rampaging through the halls.&quot; </p>

<p>The herald pricked up his anxious ears at that ...  cautious soul, he cowered, trembling, under a chair &mdash;  wrapped in an oxhide freshly stripped &mdash; to dodge black death.  He jumped in a flash from there, threw off the smelly hide  and scuttling up to Telemachus, clutching his knees,  the herald begged for life in words that fluttered:  &quot;Here 1 am, dear boy &mdash; spare me! Tell your father,  flushed with victory, not to kill me with his sword &mdash;  enraged as he is with these young lords who bled  his palace white and showed you no respect,  the reckless fools!&quot; </p>

<p>Breaking into a smile  the canny Odysseus reassured him, &quot;Courage!  The prince has pulled you through, he's saved you now </p>

<p></p>

<p>so you can take it to heart and tell the next man too:  clearly doing good puts doing bad to shame.  Now leave the palace, go and sit outside &mdash;  out in the courtyard, clear of the slaughter &mdash;  you and the bard with all his many songs.  Wait till I've done some household chores  that call for my attention.&quot; </p>

<p>The two men scurried out of the house at once  and crouched at the altar-stone of mighty Zeus &mdash;  glancing left and right,  fearing death would strike at any moment. </p>

<p>Odysseus scanned his house to see if any man  still skulked alive, still hoped to avoid black death.  But he found them one and all in blood and dust ...  great hauls of them down and out like fish that fishermen  drag from the churning gray surf in looped and coiling nets  and fling ashore on a sweeping hook of beach &mdash; some noble catch  heaped on the sand, twitching, lusting for fresh salt sea  but the Sungod hammers down and burns their lives out ...  so the suitors lay in heaps, corpse covering corpse.  At last the seasoned fighter turned to his son:  &quot;Telemachus, go, call the old nurse here &mdash;  1 must tell her all that's on my mind.&quot; </p>

<p>Telemachus ran to do his father's bidding,  shook the women's doors, calling Eury cleia:  &quot;Come out now! Up with you, good old woman!  You who watch over all the household hands &mdash;  quick, my father wants you, needs to have a word!&quot; </p>

<p>Crisp command that left the old nurse hushed &mdash;  she spread the doors to the well-constructed hall,  slipped out in haste, and the prince led her on ...  She found Odysseus in the thick of slaughtered corpses,  splattered with bloody filth like a lion that's devoured  some ox of the field and lopes home, covered with blood. </p>

<p></p>

<p>his chest streaked, both jaws gUstening, dripping red &mdash; </p>

<p>a sight to strike terror. So Odysseus looked now, </p>

<p>splattered with gore, his thighs, his fighting hands, </p>

<p>and she, when she saw the corpses, all the pooling blood, </p>

<p>was about to lift a cry of triumph &mdash; here was a great exploit, </p>

<p>look &mdash; but the soldier held her back and checked her zeal </p>

<p>with warnings winging home: &quot;Rejoice in your heart, </p>

<p>old woman &mdash; peace! No cries of triumph now. </p>

<p>It's unholy to glory over the bodies of the dead. </p>

<p>These men the doom of the gods has brought low, </p>

<p>and their own indecent acts. They 'd no regard </p>

<p>for any man on earth &mdash; good or bad &mdash; </p>

<p>who chanced to come their way. And so, thanks </p>

<p>to their reckless work, they met this shameful fate. </p>

<p>Quick, report in full on the women in my halls &mdash; </p>

<p>who are disloyal to me, who are guiltless? &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Surely, child,&quot;  his fond old nurse replied, &quot;now here's the truth.  Fifty women you have inside your house,  women we've trained to do their duties well,  to card the wool and bear the yoke of service.  Some dozen in all went tramping to their shame,  thumbing their noses at me, at the queen herself!  And Telemachus, just now come of age &mdash; his mother  would never let the boy take charge of the maids.  But let me climb to her well-lit room upstairs  and tell your wife the news &mdash;  some god has put the woman fast asleep.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Don't wake her yet,&quot; the crafty man returned,  &quot;you tell those women to hurry here at once &mdash;  just the ones who've shamed us all along.&quot; </p>

<p>Away the old nurse bustled through the house  to give the women orders, rush them to the king.  Odysseus called Telemachus over, both herdsmen too,  with strict commands: &quot;Start clearing away the bodies.  Make the women pitch in too. Chairs and tables &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>scrub them down with sponges, rinse them clean.  And once you've put the entire house in order,  march the women out of the great hall &mdash; between  the roundhouse and the courtyard's strong stockade &mdash;  and hack them with your swords, slash out all their lives &mdash;  blot out of their minds the joys of love they relished  under the suitors' bodies, rutting on the sly ! &quot; </p>

<p>The women crowded in, huddling all together ...  wailing convulsively, streaming live warm tears.  First they carried out the bodies of the dead  and propped them under the courtyard colonnade,  standing them one against another. Odysseus  shouted commands himself, moving things along,  and they kept bearing out the bodies &mdash; they were forced.  Next they scrubbed down the elegant chairs and tables,  washed them with sopping sponges, rinsed them clean.  Then Telemachus and the herdsmen scraped smooth  the packed earth floor of the royal house with spades  as the women gathered up the filth and piled it outside.  And then, at last, once the entire house was put in order,  they marched the women out of the great hall &mdash; between  the roundhouse and the courtyard's strong stockade &mdash;  crammed them into a dead end, no way out from there,  and stern Telemachus gave the men their orders:  &quot;No clean death for the likes of them, by god!  Not from /ne&mdash; they showered abuse on my head,  my mother's too! </p>

<p>You sluts &mdash; ^the suitors' whores!&quot; </p>

<p>With that, taking a cable used on a dark-prowed ship  he coiled it over the roundhouse, lashed it fast to a tall column,  hoisting it up so high no toes could touch the ground.  Then, as doves or thrushes beating their spread wings  against some snare rigged up in thickets &mdash; flying in  for a cozy nest but a grisly bed receives them &mdash;  so the women's heads were trapped in a line,  nooses yanking their necks up, one by one </p>

<p></p>

<p>so all might die a pitiful, ghastly death ...  they kicked up heels for a little &mdash; not for long. </p>

<p>Melanthius? </p>

<p>They hauled him out through the doorway, into the court,  lopped his nose and ears with a ruthless knife,  tore his genitals out for the dogs to eat raw  and in manic fury hacked off hands and feet. </p>

<p>Then, </p>

<p>once they 'd washed their own hands and feet,  they went inside again to join Odysseus.  Their work was done with now.  But the king turned to devoted Eurycleia, saying,  &quot;Bring sulfur, nurse, to scour all this pollution &mdash;  bring me fire too, so 1 can fumigate the house.  And call Penelope here with all her women &mdash;  tell all the maids to come back in at once.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well said, my boy, &quot; his old nurse replied,  &quot;right to the point. But wait,  let me fetch you a shirt and cloak to wrap you.  No more dawdling round the palace, nothing but rags  to cover those broad shoulders &mdash; it's a scandal!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Fire first,&quot; the good soldier answered.  &quot;Light me a fire to purify this house. &quot; </p>

<p>The devoted nurse snapped to his command,  brought her master fire and brimstone. Odysseus  purged his palace, halls and court, with cleansing fumes. </p>

<p>Then back through the royal house the old nurse went  to tell the women the news and bring them in at once.  They came crowding out of their quarters, torch in hand,  flung their arms around Odysseus, hugged him, home at last,  and kissed his head and shoulders, seized his hands, and he,  overcome by a lovely longing, broke down and wept ...  deep in his heart he knew them one and all. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Book XXIII </p>

<p></p>

<p>The Great  Rooted Bed </p>

<p></p>

<p>Up to the rooms the old nurse clambered, chuckling all the way, </p>

<p>to tell the queen her husband was here now, home at last. </p>

<p>Her knees bustling, feet shuffling over each other, </p>

<p>till hovering at her mistress' head she spoke: </p>

<p>&quot;Penelope &mdash; child &mdash; wake up and see for yourself, </p>

<p>with your own eyes, all you dreamed of, all your days! </p>

<p>He's here &mdash; Odysseus &mdash; he's come home, at long last! </p>

<p>He's killed the suitors, swaggering young brutes </p>

<p>who plagued his house, wolfed his cattle down, </p>

<p>rode roughshod over his son!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Dear old nurse,&quot; wary Penelope replied,  &quot;the gods have made you mad. They have that power,  putting lunacy into the clearest head around </p>

<p></p>

<p>or setting a half-wit on the path to sense.  They've unhinged you, and you were once so sane.  Why do you mock me? &mdash; haven't I wept enough? &mdash;  telhng such wild stories, interrupting my sleep,  sweet sleep that held me, sealed my eyes just now.  Not once have 1 slept so soundly since the day  Odysseus sailed away to see that cursed city ...  Destroy, 1 call it &mdash; 1 hate to say its name!  Now down you go. Back to your own quarters.  If any other woman of mine had come to me,  rousing me out of sleep with such a tale,  I'd have her bundled back to her room in pain.  It's only your old gray head that spares you that! ' </p>

<p>&quot;Never&quot; &mdash; the fond old nurse kept pressing on &mdash;  &quot;dear child, I'd never mock you! No, it's all true,  he's here &mdash; Odysseus &mdash; he's come home, just as 1 tell you!  He'sXhe stranger they all manhandled in the hall.  Telemachus knew he was here, for days and days,  but he knew enough to hide his father's plans  so could pay those vipers back in kind!&quot; </p>

<p>Penelope's heart burst in joy , she leapt from bed,  her eyes streaming tears, she hugged the old nurse  and cried out with an eager, winging word,  &quot;Please, dear one, give me the whole story.  If he's really home again, just as you tell me,  how did he get those shameless suitors in his clutches? &mdash;  single-handed, braving an army always camped inside.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;1 have no idea,&quot; the devoted nurse replied.  &quot;1 didn't see it, 1 didn't ask&mdash; all 1 heard  was the choking groans of men cut down in blood.  We crouched in terror &mdash; a dark nook of our quarters &mdash;  all of us locked tight behind those snug doors  till your boy Telemachus came and called me out &mdash;  his father rushed him there to do just that. Then  1 found Odysseus in the thick of slaughtered corpses; </p>

<p></p>

<p>there he stood and all around him, over the beaten floor,  the bodies sprawled in heaps, lying one on another ...  How it would have thrilled your heart to see him &mdash;  splattered with bloody filth, a lion with his kill!  And now they're all stacked at the courtyard gates &mdash;  he's lit a roaring fire, </p>

<p>he's purifying the house with cleansing fumes  and he's sent me here to bring you back to him.  Follow me down! So now, after all the years of grief,  you two can embark, loving hearts, along the road to joy.  Look, your dreams, put off so long, come true at last &mdash;  he's back alive, home at his hearth, and found you,  found his son still here. And all those suitors  who did him wrong, he's paid them back, he has,  right in his own house!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Hush, dear woman,&quot;  guarded Penelope cautioned her at once.  &quot;Don't laugh, don't cry in triumph &mdash; not yet.  You know how welcome the sight of him would be  to all in the house, and to me most of all  and the son we bore together.  But the story can't be true, not as you tell it,  no, it must be a god who's killed our brazen friends &mdash;  up in arms at their outrage, heartbreaking crimes.  They'd no regard for any man on earth &mdash;  good or bad &mdash; ^who chanced to come their way. So,  thanks to their reckless work they die their deaths.  Odysseus? Far from Achaea now, he's lost all hope  of coming home ... he's lost and gone himself.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Child,&quot; the devoted old nurse protested,  &quot;what nonsense you let slip through your teeth.  Here's your husband, warming his hands at his own hearth,  here &mdash; and you, you say he'll never come home again,  always the soul of trust! All right, this too &mdash;  I'll give you a sign, a proof that's plain as day.  That scar, made years ago by a boar's white tusk &mdash;  1 spotted the scar myself, when 1 washed his feet. </p>

<p></p>

<p>and I tried to tell you, ah, but he, the crafty rascal, </p>

<p>clamped his hand on my mouth &mdash; 1 couldn't say a word. </p>

<p>Follow me down now. I'll stake my life on it: </p>

<p>if 1 am lying to you &mdash; </p>

<p>kill me with a thousand knives of pain!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Dear old nurse, &quot; composed Penelope responded,  &quot;deep as you are, my friend, you'll find it hard  to plumb the plans of the everlasting gods.  All the same, let 's go and join my son  so 1 can see the suitors lying dead  and see ... the one who killed them.&quot; </p>

<p>With that thought  Penelope started down from her lofty room, her heart  in turmoil, torn ... should she keep her distance,  probe her husband? Or rush up to the man at once  and kiss his head and cling to both his hands?  As soon as she stepped across the stone threshold,  slipping in, she took a seat at the closest wall  and radiant in the firelight, faced Odysseus now.  There he sat, leaning against the great central column,  eyes fixed on the ground, waiting, poised for whatever words  his hardy wife might say when she caught sight of him.  A long while she sat in silence ... numbing wonder  filled her heart as her eyes explored his face.  One moment he seemed ... Odysseus, to the life &mdash;  the next, no, he was not the man she knew,  a huddled mass of rags was all she saw. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh mother,&quot; Telemachus reproached her,  &quot;cruel mother, you with your hard heart!  Why do you spurn my father so &mdash; ^why don't you  sit beside him, engage him, ask him questions?  What other wife could have a spirit so unbending?  Holding back from her husband, home at last for her  after bearing twenty years of brutal struggle &mdash;  your heart was always harder than a rock!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;My child,&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>Penelope, well-aware, explained, &quot;I'm stunned with wonder, </p>

<p>powerless. Cannot speak to him, ask him questions, </p>

<p>look him in the eyes ... But if he is truly </p>

<p>Odysseus, home at last, make no mistake: </p>

<p>we two will know each other, even better &mdash; </p>

<p>we two have secret signs, </p>

<p>known to us both but hidden from the world. &quot; </p>

<p>Odysseus, long-enduring, broke into a smile  and turned to his son with pointed, winging words:  &quot;Leave your mother here in the hall to test me  as she will. She soon will know me better.  Now because 1 am filthy, wear such grimy rags,  she spurns me &mdash; your mother still can't bring herself  to believe 1 am her husband. </p>

<p>But you and 1,  put heads together. What's our best defense?  When someone kills a lone man in the realm  who leaves behind him no great band of avengers,  still the killer flees, goodbye to kin and country.  But tvie brought down the best of the island's princes,  the pillars of Ithaca. Weigh it well, 1 urge you.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Look to it all yourself now, father,&quot; his son  deferred at once. &quot;You are the best on earth,  they say, when it comes to mapping tactics.  No one, no mortal man, can touch you there.  But we're behind you, hearts intent on battle,  nor do 1 think you'll find us short on courage,  long as our strength will last. &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Then here's our plan,&quot;  the master of tactics said. &quot;1 think it's best.  First go and wash, and pull fresh tunics on,  and tell the maids in the hall to dress well too.  And let the inspired bard take up his ringing lyre  and lead off for us all a dance so full of heart  that whoever hears the strains outside the gates &mdash;  a passerby on the road, a neighbor round about &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>will think it's a wedding-feast that's under way. </p>

<p>No news of the suitors' death must spread through town </p>

<p>till we have slipped away to our own estates, </p>

<p>our orchard green with trees. There we'll see </p>

<p>what winning strategy Zeus will hand us then. ' </p>

<p>They hung on his words and moved to orders smartly.  First they washed and pulled fresh tunics on,  the women arrayed themselves &mdash; the inspired bard  struck up his resounding lyre and stirred in all  a desire for dance and song, the lovely lilting beat,  till the great house echoed round to the measured tread  of dancing men in motion, women sashed and lithe.  And whoever heard the strains outside would say,  &quot;A miracle &mdash; someone's married the queen at last! ' </p>

<p>&quot;One of her hundred suitors. ' </p>

<p>&quot;That callous woman,  too faithless to keep her lord and master's house  to the bitter end &mdash; &quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Till he came sailing home.&quot; </p>

<p>So they'd say, blind to what had happened:  the great-hearted Odysseus was home again at last.  The maid Eurynome bathed him, rubbed him down with oil  and drew around him a royal cape and choice tunic too.  And Athena crowned the man with beauty, head to foot,  made him taller to all eyes, his build more massive,  yes, and down from his brow the great goddess  ran his curls like thick hyacinth clusters  full of blooms. As a master craftsman washes  gold over beaten silver &mdash; a man the god of fire  and Queen Athena trained in every fine technique &mdash;  and finishes of his latest effort, handsome work ...  so she lavished splendor over his head and shoulders now.  He stepped from his bath, glistening like a god,  and back he went to the seat that he had left  and facing his wife, declared. </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Strange woman! So hard &mdash; the gods of Olympus  made you harder than any other woman in the world!  What other wife could have a spirit so unbending?  Holding back from her husband, home at last for her  after bearing twenty years of brutal struggle.  Come, nurse, make me a bed, I'll sleep alone.  She has a heart of iron in her breast.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Strange /72a/7/'  wary Penelope said. &quot;I'm not so proud, so scornful,  nor am 1 overwhelmed by your quick change ...  You look &mdash; how well 1 know &mdash; the way he looked,  setting sail from Ithaca years ago  aboard the long-oared ship. </p>

<p>Come, Eurycleia,  move the sturdy bedstead out of our bridal chamber &mdash;  that room the master built with his own hands.  Take it out now, sturdy bed that it is,  and spread it deep with fleece,  blankets and lustrous throws to keep him warm.&quot; </p>

<p>Putting her husband to the proof &mdash; but Odysseus  blazed up in fury, lashing out at his loyal wife:  &quot;Woman &mdash; your words, they cut me to the core!  Who could move my bed? Impossible task,  even for some skilled craftsman &mdash; unless a god  came down in person, quick to lend a hand,  lifted it out with ease and moved it elsewhere.  Not a man on earth, not even at peak strength,  would find it easy to prise it up and shift it, no,  a great sign, a hallmark lies in its construction.  1 know, 1 built it myself &mdash; no one else ...  There was a branching olive-tree inside our court,  grown to its full prime, the bole like a column, thickset.  Around it 1 built my bedroom, finished off the walls  with good tight stonework, roofed it over soundly  and added doors, hung well and snugly wedged.  Then 1 lopped the leafy crown of the olive,  clean-cutting the stump bare from roots up. </p>

<p></p>

<p>planing it round with a bronze smoothing-adze &mdash;  I had the skill &mdash; I shaped it plumb to the line to make  my bedpost, bored the holes it needed with an auger.  Working from there 1 built my bed, start to finish,  1 gave it ivory inlays, gold and silver fittings,  wove the straps across it, oxhide gleaming red.  There's our secret sign, 1 tell you, our life story!  Does the bed, my lady, still stand planted firm? &mdash;  1 don't know &mdash; or has someone chopped away  that olive-trunk and hauled our bedstead off? &quot; </p>

<p>Living proof &mdash;  Penelope felt her knees go slack, her heart surrender,  recognizing the strong clear signs Odysseus offered.  She dissolved in tears, rushed to Odysseus, flung her arms  around his neck and kissed his head and cried out,  &quot; Odysseus&mdash; &amp;amp;OYi\. flare up at me now, not you,  always the most understanding man alive!  The gods, it was the gods who sent us sorrow &mdash;  they grudged us both a life in each other's arms  from the heady zest of youth to the stoop of old age.  But don't fault me, angry with me now because 1 failed,  at the first glimpse, to greet you, hold you, so ...  In my heart of hearts 1 always cringed with fear  some fraud might come, beguile me with his talk;  the world is full of the sort,  cunning ones who plot their own dark ends.  Remember Helen of Argos, Zeus's daughter &mdash;  would shehsMe sported so in a stranger's bed  if she had dreamed that Achaea's sons were doomed  to fight and die to bring her home again?  Some god spurred her to do her shameless work.  Not till then did her mind conceive that madness,  blinding madness that caused her anguish, ours as well.  But now, since you have revealed such overwhelming proof &mdash;  the secret sign of our bed, which no one's ever seen  but you and 1 and a single handmaid, Actoris,  the servant my father gave me when 1 came. </p>

<p></p>

<p>who kept the doors of our room you built so well ...  you've conquered my heart, my hard heart, at last!&quot; </p>

<p>The more she spoke, the more a deep desire for tears  welled up inside his breast &mdash; he wept as he held the wife  he loved, the soul of loyalty, in his arms at last.  Joy, warm as the joy that shipwrecked sailors feel  when they catch sight of land &mdash; Poseidon has struck  their well-rigged ship on the open sea with gale winds  and crushing walls of waves, and only a few escape, swimming,  struggling out of the frothing surf to reach the shore,  their bodies crusted with salt but buoyed up with joy  as they plant their feet on solid ground again,  spared a deadly fate. So joyous now to her  the sight of her husband, vivid in her gaze,  that her white arms, embracing his neck  would never for a moment let him go ...  Dawn with her rose-red fingers might have shone  upon their tears, if with her glinting eyes  Athena had not thought of one more thing.  She held back the night, and night lingered long  at the western edge of the earth, while in the east  she reined in Dawn of the golden throne at Ocean's banks,  commanding her not to yoke the windswift team that brings men light.  Blaze and Aurora, the young colts that race the Morning on.  Yet now Odysseus, seasoned veteran, said to his wife,  &quot;Dear woman ... we have still not reached the end  of all our trials. One more labor lies in store &mdash;  boundless, laden with danger, great and long,  and 1 must brave it out from start to finish.  So the ghost of Tiresias prophesied to me,  the day that 1 went down to the House of Death  to learn our best route home, my comrades' and my own.  But come, let's go to bed, dear woman &mdash; at long last  delight in sleep, delight in each other, come!&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;If it's bed you want, &quot; reserved Penelope replied,  &quot;it's bed you'll have, whenever the spirit moves,  now that the gods have brought you home again  to native land, your grand and gracious house.  But since you've alluded to it,  since a god has put it in your mind,  please, tell me about this trial still to come.  I'm bound to learn of it later, 1 am sure &mdash;  what's the harm if 1 hear of it tonight?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Still so strange,&quot;  Odysseus, the old master of stories, answered.  &quot;Why again, why force me to tell you all?  Well, tell 1 shall. I'll hide nothing now.  But little joy it will bring you, I'm afraid,  as little joy for me. </p>

<p>The prophet said  that 1 must rove through towns on towns of men,  that 1 must carry a well-planed oar until  1 come to a people who know nothing of the sea,  whose food is never seasoned with salt, strangers all  to ships with their crimson prows and long slim oars,  wings that make ships fly. And here is my sign,  he told me, clear, so clear I cannot miss it,  and 1 will share it with you now ...  When another traveler falls in with me and calls  that weight across my shoulder a fan to winnow grain,  then, he told me, 1 must plant my oar in the earth  and sacrifice fine beasts to the lord god of the sea,  Poseidon &mdash; a ram, a bull and a ramping wild boar &mdash;  then journey home and render noble offerings up  to the deathless gods who rule the vaulting skies,  to all the gods in order. </p>

<p>And at last my own death will steal upon me ... </p>

<p>a gentle, painless death, far from the sea it comes </p>

<p>to take me down, borne down with the years in ripe old age </p>

<p>with all my people here in blessed peace around me. </p>

<p>All this, the prophet said, will come to pass.&quot; </p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;And so, &quot; Penelope said, in her great wisdom,  &quot;if the gods will really grant a happier old age,  there's hope that we'll escape our trials at last.&quot; </p>

<p>So husband and wife confided in each other,  while nurse and Eurynome, under the flaring brands,  were making up the bed with coverings deep and soft.  And working briskly, soon as they'd made it snug,  back to her room the old nurse went to sleep  as Eurynome, their attendant, torch in hand,  lighted the royal couple's way to bed and,  leading them to their chamber, slipped away.  Rejoicing in each other, they returned to their bed,  the old familiar place they loved so well. </p>

<p>Now Telemachus, the cowherd and the swineherd  rested their dancing feet and had the women do the same,  and across the shadowed hall the men lay down to sleep. </p>

<p>But the royal couple, once they'd reveled in all  the longed-for joys of love, reveled in each other's stories,  the radiant woman telling of all she'd borne at home,  watching them there, the infernal crowd of suitors  slaughtering herds of cattle and good fat sheep &mdash;  while keen to win her hand &mdash;  draining the broached vats dry of vintage wine.  And great Odysseus told his wife of all the pains  he had dealt out to other men and all the hardships  he'd endured himself &mdash; his story first to last &mdash;  and she listened on, enchanted ...  Sleep never sealed her eyes till all was told. </p>

<p>He launched in with how he fought the Cicones down,  then how he came to the Lotus-eaters' lush green land.  Then all the crimes of the Cyclops and how he paid him back  for the gallant men the monster ate without a qualm &mdash;  then how he visited Aeolus, who gave him a hero's welcome  then he sent him off, but the homeward run was not his fate,  not yet &mdash; some sudden squalls snatched him away once more </p>

<p></p>

<p>and drove him over the swarming sea, groaning in despair. </p>

<p>Then how he moored at Telepylus, where Laestrygonians </p>

<p>wrecked his fleet and killed his men-at-arms. </p>

<p>He told her of Circe's cunning magic wiles </p>

<p>and how he voyaged down in his long benched ship </p>

<p>to the moldering House of Death, to consult Tiresias, </p>

<p>ghostly seer of Thebes, and he saw old comrades there </p>

<p>and he saw his mother, who bore and reared him as a child. </p>

<p>He told how he caught the Sirens' voices throbbing in the wind </p>

<p>and how he had scudded past the Clashing Rocks, past grim Charybdis, </p>

<p>past Scylla &mdash; whom no rover had ever coasted by, home free &mdash; </p>

<p>and how his shipmates slaughtered the cattle of the Sun </p>

<p>and Zeus the king of thunder split his racing ship </p>

<p>with a reeking bolt and killed his hardy comrades, </p>

<p>all his fighting men at a stroke, but he alone </p>

<p>escaped their death at sea. He told how he reached </p>

<p>Ogygia's shores and the nymph Calypso held him back, </p>

<p>deep in her arching caverns, craving him for a husband &mdash; </p>

<p>cherished him, vowed to make him immortal, ageless, all his days, </p>

<p>yes, but she never won the heart inside him, never ... </p>

<p>then how he reached the Phaeacians &mdash; heavy sailing there &mdash; </p>

<p>who with all their hearts had prized him like a god </p>

<p>and sent him off in a ship to his own beloved land, </p>

<p>giving him bronze and hoards of gold and robes ... </p>

<p>and that was the last he told her, just as sleep </p>

<p>overcame him ... sleep loosing his limbs, </p>

<p>slipping the toils of anguish from his mind. </p>

<p>Athena, her eyes afire, had fresh plans.  Once she thought he'd had his heart's content  of love and sleep at his wife's side, straightaway  she roused young Dawn from Ocean's banks to her golden throne  to bring men light and roused Odysseus too, who rose  from his soft bed and advised his wife in parting,  &quot;Dear woman, we both have had our fill of trials.  You in our house, weeping over my journey home,  fraught with storms and torment, true, and 1,  pinned down in pain by Zeus and other gods. </p>

<p></p>

<p>for all my desire, blocked from reaching home. </p>

<p>But now that we've arrived at our bed together &mdash; </p>

<p>the reunion that we yearned for all those years &mdash; </p>

<p>look after the things still left me in our house. </p>

<p>But as for the flocks those strutting suitors plundered, </p>

<p>much I'll recoup myself, making many raids; </p>

<p>the rest our fellow-lthacans will supply </p>

<p>till all my folds are full of sheep again. </p>

<p>But now 1 must be off to the upland farm, </p>

<p>our orchard green with trees, to see my father, </p>

<p>good old man weighed down with so much grief for me. </p>

<p>And you, dear woman, sensible as you are, </p>

<p>1 would advise you, still ... </p>

<p>quick as the rising sun the news will spread </p>

<p>of the suitors that 1 killed inside the house. </p>

<p>So climb to your lofty chamber with your women. </p>

<p>Sit tight there. See no one. Question no one.&quot; </p>

<p>He strapped his burnished armor round his shoulders,  roused Telemachus, the cowherd and the swineherd,  and told them to take up weapons honed for battle.  They snapped to commands, harnessed up in bronze,  opened the doors and strode out, Odysseus in the lead.  By now the daylight covered the land, but Pallas,  shrouding them all in darkness,  quickly led the four men out of town. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Book XXIV </p>

<p></p>

<p>Peace </p>

<p></p>

<p>Now Cyllenian Hermes called away the suitors' ghosts, </p>

<p>holding firm in his hand the wand of fine pure gold </p>

<p>that enchants the eyes of men whenever Hermes wants </p>

<p>or wakes us up from sleep. </p>

<p>With a wave of this he stirred and led them on </p>

<p>and the ghosts trailed after with high thin cries </p>

<p>as bats cry in the depths of a dark haunted cavern, </p>

<p>shrilling, flittering, wild when one drops from the chain &mdash; </p>

<p>slipped from the rock face, while the rest cling tight ... </p>

<p>So with their high thin cries the ghosts flocked now </p>

<p>and Hermes the Healer led them on, and down the dank </p>

<p>moldering paths and past the Ocean's streams they went </p>

<p>and past the White Rock and the Sun's Western Gates and past </p>

<p>the Land of Dreams, and they soon reached the fields of asphodel </p>

<p>where the dead, the burnt-out wraiths of mortals, make their home. </p>

<p></p>

<p>There they found the ghosts of Peleus' son Achilles,  Patroclus, fearless Antilochus &mdash; and Great Ajax too,  the first in stature, first in build and bearing  of all the Argives after Peleus' matchless son.  They had grouped around Achilles' ghost, and now  the shade of Atreus' son Agamemnon marched toward them &mdash;  fraught with grief and flanked by all his comrades,  troops of his men-at-arms who died beside him,  who met their fate in lord Aegisthus' halls.  Achilles' ghost was first to greet him: &quot;Agamemnon,  you were the one, we thought, of all our fighting princes  Zeus who loves the lightning favored most, all your days,  because you commanded such a powerful host of men  on the fields of Troy where we Achaeans suffered.  But you were doomed to encounter fate so early,  you too, yet no one born escapes its deadly force.  If only you had died your death in the full flush  of the glory you had mastered &mdash; died on Trojan soil!  Then all united Achaea would have raised your tomb  and you'd have won your son great fame for years to come.  Not so. You were fated to die a wretched death.&quot; </p>

<p>And the ghost of Atrides Agamemnon answered,  &quot;Son of Peleus, great godlike Achilles! Happy man,  you died on the fields of Troy, a world away from home,  and the best of Trojan and Argive champions died around you,  fighting for your corpse. And you ... there you lay  in the whirling dust, overpowered in all your power  and wiped from memory all your horseman's skills.  That whole day we fought, we'd never have stopped  if Zeus had not stopped f/5with sudden gales.  Then we bore you out of the fighting, onto the ships,  we laid you down on a litter, cleansed your handsome flesh  with warm water and soothing oils, and round your body  troops of Danaans wept hot tears and cut their locks. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Hearing the news, your mother, Thetis, rose from the sea, </p>

<p>immortal sea-nymphs in her wake, and a strange unearthly cry </p>

<p>came throbbing over the ocean. Terror gripped Achaea's armies, </p>

<p>they would have leapt in panic, boarded the long hollow ships </p>

<p>if one man, deep in his age-old wisdom, had not checked them: </p>

<p>Nestor &mdash; from the first his counsel always seemed the best, </p>

<p>and now, concerned for the ranks, he rose and shouted, </p>

<p>'Hold fast, Argives! Sons of Achaea, don't run now! </p>

<p>This is Achilles' mother rising from the sea </p>

<p>with all her immortal sea-nymphs &mdash; </p>

<p>she longs to join her son who died in battle!' </p>

<p>That stopped our panicked forces in their tracks </p>

<p>as the Old Man of the Sea's daughters gathered round you &mdash; </p>

<p>wailing, heartsick &mdash; dressed you in ambrosial, deathless robes </p>

<p>and the Muses, nine in all, voice-to-voice in choirs, </p>

<p>their vibrant music rising, raised your dirge. </p>

<p>Not one soldier would you have seen dry-eyed, </p>

<p>the Muses' song so pierced us to the heart. </p>

<p>For seventeen days unbroken, days and nights </p>

<p>we mourned you &mdash; immortal gods and mortal men. </p>

<p>At the eighteenth dawn we gave you to the flames </p>

<p>and slaughtered around your body droves of fat sheep </p>

<p>and shambling longhorn cattle, and you were burned </p>

<p>in the garments of the gods and laved with soothing oils </p>

<p>and honey running sweet, and a long cortege of Argive heroes </p>

<p>paraded in review, in battle armor round your blazing pyre, </p>

<p>men in chariots, men on foot &mdash; a resounding roar went up. </p>

<p>And once the god of fire had burned your corpse to ash, </p>

<p>at first light we gathered your white bones, Achilles, </p>

<p>cured them in strong neat wine and seasoned oils. </p>

<p>Your mother gave us a gold two-handled urn, </p>

<p>a gift from Dionysus, she said, </p>

<p>a masterwork of the famous Smith, the god of fire. </p>

<p>Your white bones rest in that, my brilliant Achilles, </p>

<p>mixed with the bones of dead Patroclus, Menoetius' son, </p>

<p>apart from those of Antilochus, whom you treasured </p>

<p>more than all other comrades once Patroclus died. </p>

<p>Over your bones we reared a grand, noble tomb &mdash; </p>

<p></p>

<p>devoted veterans all, Achaea's combat forces &mdash;  high on its jutting headland over the Hellespont 's  broad reach, a landmark glimpsed from far out at sea  by men of our own day and men of days to come. </p>

<p>And then </p>

<p>your mother, begging the gods for priceless trophies, </p>

<p>set them out in the ring for all our champions. </p>

<p>You in your day have witnessed funeral games </p>

<p>for many heroes, games to honor the death of kings, </p>

<p>when young men cinch their belts, tense to win some prize &mdash; </p>

<p>but if you'd laid eyes on theseiX. would have thrilled your heart, </p>

<p>magnificent trophies the goddess, glistening-footed Thetis, </p>

<p>held out in your honor. You were dear to the gods, </p>

<p>so even in death your name will never die ... </p>

<p>Great glory is yours, Achilles, </p>

<p>for all time, in the eyes of all mankind! </p>

<p>But 1? </p>

<p>What joy for /Tie when the coil of war had wound down? </p>

<p>For 772^ return Zeus hatched a pitiful death </p>

<p>at the hands of Aegisthus &mdash; and my accursed wife.&quot; </p>

<p>As they exchanged the stories of their fates,  Hermes the guide and giant-killer drew up close to both,  leading down the ghosts of the suitors King Odysseus killed.  Struck by the sight, the two went up to them right away  and the ghost of Atreus' son Agamemnon recognized  the noted prince Amphimedon, Melaneus' dear son  who received him once in Ithaca, at his home,  and Atrides' ghost called out to his old friend now,  &quot;Amphimedon, what disaster brings you down to the dark world?  All of you, good picked men, and all in your prime &mdash;  no captain out to recruit the best in any city  could have chosen better. What laid you low?  Wrecked in the ships when lord Poseidon roused  some punishing blast of gales and heavy breakers?  Or did ranks of enemies mow you down on land  as you tried to raid and cut off herds and flocks  or fought to win their city, take their women? </p>

<p></p>

<p>Answer me, tell me. 1 was once your guest. </p>

<p>Don't you recall the day 1 came to visit </p>

<p>your house in Ithaca &mdash; King Menelaus came too &mdash; </p>

<p>to urge Odysseus to sail with us in the ships </p>

<p>on our campaign to Troy? And the long slow voyage, </p>

<p>crossing wastes of ocean, cost us one whole month. </p>

<p>That's how hard it was to bring him round, </p>

<p>Odysseus, raider of cities.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Famous Atrides! &quot;  Amphimedon's ghost called back. &quot;Lord of men, Agamemnon,  1 remember it all, your majesty, as you say,  and 1 will tell you, start to finish now,  the story of our death,  the brutal end contrived to take us off.  We were courting the wife of Odysseus, gone so long.  She neither spurned nor embraced a marriage she despised,  no, she simply planned our death, our black doom!  7]&amp;amp;/5was her latest masterpiece of guile:  she set up a great loom in the royal halls  and she began to weave, and the weaving finespun,  the yarns endless, and she would lead us on: 'Young men,  my suitors, now that King Odysseus is no more,  go slowly, keen as you are to marry me, until  1 can finish off this web ... </p>

<p>so my weaving won't all fray and come to nothing. </p>

<p>This is a shroud for old lord Laertes, for that day </p>

<p>when the deadly fate that lays us out at last will take him down. </p>

<p>1 dread the shame my countrywomen would heap upon me, </p>

<p>yes, if a man of such wealth should lie in state </p>

<p>without a shroud for cover.' </p>

<p>Her very words,  and despite our pride and passion we believed her.  So by day she'd weave at her great and growing web &mdash;  by night, by the light of torches set beside her,  she would unravel all she'd done. Three whole years  she deceived us blind, seduced us with this scheme ...  Then, when the wheeling seasons brought the fourth year on  and the months waned and the long days came round once more. </p>

<p></p>

<p>one of her women, in on the queen's secret, told the truth </p>

<p>and we caught her in the act &mdash; unweaving her gorgeous web. </p>

<p>So she finished it off. Against her will. We forced her. </p>

<p>But just as she bound off that great shroud and washed it, </p>

<p>spread it out &mdash; glistening like the sunlight or the moon &mdash; </p>

<p>just then some wicked spirit brought Odysseus back, </p>

<p>from god knows where, to the edge of his estate </p>

<p>where the swineherd kept his pigs. And back too, </p>

<p>to the same place, came Odysseus' own dear son, </p>

<p>scudding home in his black ship from sandy Pylos. </p>

<p>The pair of them schemed our doom, our deathtrap, </p>

<p>then lit out for town &mdash; </p>

<p>Telemachus first in fact, Odysseus followed, </p>

<p>later, led by the swineherd, and clad in tatters, </p>

<p>looking for all the world like an old and broken beggar </p>

<p>hunched on a stick, his body wrapped in shameful rags. </p>

<p>Disguised so none of us, not even the older ones, </p>

<p>could spot that tramp for the man he really was, </p>

<p>bursting in on us there, out of the blue. No, </p>

<p>we attacked him, blows and insults flying fast, </p>

<p>and he took it all for a time, in his own house, </p>

<p>all the taunts and blows &mdash; he had a heart of iron. </p>

<p>But once the will of thundering Zeus had roused his blood, </p>

<p>he and Telemachus bore the burnished weapons off </p>

<p>and stowed them deep in a storeroom, shot the bolts </p>

<p>and he &mdash; the soul of cunning &mdash; ^told his wife to set </p>

<p>the great bow and the gleaming iron axes out </p>

<p>before the suitors &mdash; all of us doomed now &mdash; </p>

<p>to test our skill and bring our slaughter on ... </p>

<p>Not one of us had the strength to string that powerful weapon, </p>

<p>all of us fell far short of what it took. But then, </p>

<p>when the bow was coming round to Odysseus' hands, </p>

<p>we raised a hue and cry &mdash; he must not have it, </p>

<p>no matter how he begged! Only Telemachus </p>

<p>urged him to take it up, and once he got it </p>

<p>in his clutches, long-suffering great Odysseus </p>

<p>strung his bow with ease and shot through all the axes, </p>

<p>then, vaulting onto the threshold, stood there poised, and pouring </p>

<p></p>

<p>his flashing arrows out before him, glaring for the kill,  he cut Antinous down, then shot his painful arrows  into the rest of us, aiming straight and true,  and down we went, corpse on corpse in droves.  Clearly a god was driving him and all his henchmen,  routing us headlong in their fury down the hall,  wheeling into the slaughter, slashing left and right  and grisly screams broke from skulls cracked open &mdash;  the whole floor awash with blood. </p>

<p>So we died, </p>

<p>Agamemnon ... our bodies lie untended even now,  strewn in Odysseus' palace. They know nothing yet,  the kin in our houses who might wash our wounds  of clotted gore and lay us out and mourn us.  These are the solemn honors owed the dead.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Happy Odysseus!&quot;  Agamemnon's ghost cried out. &quot;Son of old Laertes &mdash;  mastermind &mdash; ^what a fine, faithful wife you won!  What good sense resided in your Penelope &mdash;  how well Icarius' daughter remembered you,  Odysseus, the man she married once!  The fame of her great virtue will never die.  The immortal gods will lift a song for all mankind,  a glorious song in praise of self-possessed Penelope.  A far cry from the daughter of Tyndareus, Clytemnestra &mdash;  what outrage she committed, killing the man 5Ae married once! &mdash;  yes, and the song men sing of her will ring with loathing.  She brands with a foul name the breed of womankind,  even the honest ones to come!&quot; </p>

<p>So they traded stories,  the two ghosts standing there in the House of Death,  far in the hidden depths below the earth. </p>

<p>Odysseus and his men had stridden down from town  and quickly reached Laertes' large, well-tended farm  that the old king himself had wrested from the wilds,  years ago, laboring long and hard. His lodge was here  and around it stretched a row of sheds where fieldhands. </p>

<p></p>

<p>bondsmen who did his bidding, sat and ate and slept. </p>

<p>With an old Sicilian woman, too, much in charge, </p>

<p>who faithfully looked after her aged master </p>

<p>out on his good estate remote from town. </p>

<p>Odysseus told his servants and his son, </p>

<p>&quot;Into the timbered lodge now, go, quickly, </p>

<p>kill us the fattest porker, fix our meal. </p>

<p>And 1 will put my father to the test, </p>

<p>see if the old man knows me now, on sight, </p>

<p>or fails to, after twenty years apart.&quot; </p>

<p>With that he passed his armor to his men  and in they went at once, his son as well. Odysseus  wandered off, approaching the thriving vineyard, searching,  picking his way down to the great orchard, searching,  but found neither Dolius nor his sons nor any hand.  They'd just gone off, old Dolius in the lead,  to gather stones for a dry retaining wall  to shore the vineyard up. But he did find  his father, alone, on that well-worked plot,  spading round a sapling &mdash; clad in filthy rags,  in a patched, unseemly shirt, and round his shins  he had some oxhide leggings strapped, patched too,  to keep from getting scraped, and gloves on his hands  to fight against the thorns, and on his head  he wore a goatskin skullcap  to cultivate his misery that much more ...  Long-enduring Odysseus, catching sight of him now &mdash;  a man worn down with years, his heart racked with sorrow &mdash;  halted under a branching pear-tree, paused and wept.  Debating, head and heart, what should he do now?  Kiss and embrace his father, pour out the long tale &mdash;  how he had made the journey home to native land &mdash;  or probe him first and test him every way?  Torn, mulling it over, this seemed better:  test the old man first, </p>

<p>reproach him with words that cut him to the core.  Convinced, Odysseus went right up to his father. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Laertes was digging round the sapling, head bent low </p>

<p>as his famous offspring hovered over him and began, </p>

<p>&quot;You want no skill, old man, at tending a garden. </p>

<p>All's well-kept here; not one thing in the plot, </p>

<p>no plant, no fig, no pear, no olive, no vine, </p>

<p>not a vegetable, lacks your tender, loving care. </p>

<p>But 1 must say &mdash; and don't be offended now &mdash; </p>

<p>your plants are doing better than yourself. </p>

<p>Enough to be stooped with age </p>

<p>but look how squalid you are, those shabby rags. </p>

<p>Surely it's not for sloth your master lets you go to seed. </p>

<p>There's nothing of slave about your build or bearing. </p>

<p>1 have eyes: you look like a king to me. The sort </p>

<p>entitled to bathe, sup well, then sleep in a soft bed. </p>

<p>That's the right and pride of you old-timers. </p>

<p>Come now, tell me &mdash; in no uncertain terms &mdash; </p>

<p>whose slave are you? whose orchard are you tending? </p>

<p>And tell me this &mdash; 1 must be absolutely sure &mdash; </p>

<p>this place I've reached, is it truly Ithaca? </p>

<p>Just as that fellow told me, just now ... </p>

<p>1 fell in with him on the road here. Clumsy, </p>

<p>none too friendly, couldn't trouble himself </p>

<p>to hear me out or give me a decent answer </p>

<p>when 1 asked about a long-lost friend of mine, </p>

<p>whether he's still alive, somewhere in Ithaca, </p>

<p>or dead and gone already, lost in the House of Death. </p>

<p>Do you want to hear his story? Listen. Catch my drift. </p>

<p>1 once played host to a man in my own country; </p>

<p>he'd come to my door, the most welcome guest </p>

<p>from foreign parts 1 ever entertained. </p>

<p>He claimed he came of good Ithacan stock, </p>

<p>said his father was Arcesius' son, Laertes. </p>

<p>So 1 took the new arrival under my own roof, </p>

<p>1 gave him a hero's welcome, treated him in style &mdash; </p>

<p>stores in our palace made for princely entertainment. </p>

<p>And 1 gave my friend some gifts to fit his station, </p>

<p>handed him seven bars of well-wrought gold, </p>

<p>a mixing-bowl of solid silver, etched with flowers. </p>

<p></p>

<p>a dozen cloaks, unlined and light, a dozen rugs  and as many full-cut capes and shirts as well,  and to top it off, four women, perfect beauties  skilled in crafts &mdash; he could pick them out himself.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Stranger,&quot; his father answered, weeping softly,  &quot;the land you've reached is the very one you're after,  true, but it's in the grip of reckless, lawless men.  And as for the gifts you showered on your guest,  you gave them all for nothing.  But if you'd found him alive, here in Ithaca,  he would have replied in kind, with gift for gift,  and entertained you warmly before he sent you off.  That's the old custom, when one has led the way.  But tell me, please &mdash; in no uncertain terms &mdash;  how many years ago did you host the man,  that unfortunate guest of yours, my son ...  there was a son, or was he all a dream?  That most unlucky man, whom now, 1 fear,  far from his own soil and those he loves,  the fish have swallowed down on the high seas  or birds and beasts on land have made their meal.  Nor could the ones who bore him &mdash; mother, father &mdash;  wrap his corpse in a shroud and mourn him deeply.  Nor could his warm, generous wife, so self-possessed,  Penelope, ever keen for her husband on his deathbed,  the fit and proper way, or close his eyes at last.  These are the solemn honors owed the dead.  But tell me your own story &mdash; that I'd like to know:  Who are you? where are you from? your city? your parents?  Where does the ship lie moored that brought you here,  your hardy shipmates too? Or did you arrive  as a passenger aboard some stranger's craft  and men who put you ashore have pulled away?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The whole tale,&quot;  his crafty son replied, &quot;I'll tell you start to finish.  1 come from Roamer-Town, my home's a famous place,  my father's Unsparing, son of old King Pain, </p>

<p></p>

<p>and my name's Man of Strife ... </p>

<p>I sailed from Sicily, aye, but some ill wind </p>

<p>blew me here, off course &mdash; much against my will &mdash; </p>

<p>and my ship lies moored off farmlands far from town. </p>

<p>As for Odysseus, well, five years have passed </p>

<p>since he left my house and put my land behind him, </p>

<p>luckless man! But the birds were good as he launched out, </p>

<p>all on the right, and 1 rejoiced as 1 sent him off </p>

<p>and he rejoiced in sailing. We had high hopes </p>

<p>we'd meet again as guests, as old friends, </p>

<p>and trade some shining gifts.&quot; </p>

<p>At those words  a black cloud of grief came shrouding over Laertes.  Both hands clawing the ground for dirt and grime,  he poured it over his grizzled head, sobbing, in spasms.  Odysseus' heart shuddered, a sudden twinge went shooting up  through his nostrils, watching his dear father struggle ...  He sprang toward him, kissed him, hugged him, crying,  &quot;Father &mdash; 1 am your son &mdash; myself, the man you're seeking,  home after twenty years, on native ground at last!  Hold back your tears, your grief.  Let me tell you the news, but we must hurry &mdash;  I've cut the suitors down in our own house,  I've paid them back their outrage, vicious crimes!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Odysseus </p>

<p>Laertes, catching his breath, found words to answer.  &quot;You &mdash; you're truly my son, Odysseus, home at last?  Give me a sign, some proof &mdash; 1 must be sure.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;This scar first,&quot;  quick to the mark, his son said, &quot;look at this &mdash;  the wound 1 took from the boar's white tusk  on Mount Parnassus. There you'd sent me, you  and mother, to see her fond old father, Autolycus,  and collect the gifts he vowed to give me, once,  when he came to see us here. </p>

<p>Or these, these trees &mdash;  let me tell you the trees you gave me years ago,  here on this well-worked plot ... </p>

<p></p>

<p>I begged you for everything I saw, a little boy  trailing you through the orchard, picking our way  among these trees, and you named them one by one.  You gave me thirteen pear, ten apple trees  and forty figs &mdash; and promised to give me, look,  fifty vinerows, bearing hard on each other's heels,  clusters of grapes year-round at every grade of ripeness,  mellowed as Zeus's seasons weigh them down. &quot; </p>

<p>Living proof &mdash;  and Laertes' knees went slack, his heart surrendered,  recognizing the strong clear signs Odysseus offered.  He threw his arms around his own dear son, fainting  as hardy great Odysseus hugged him to his heart  until he regained his breath, came back to life  and cried out, &quot;Father Zeus &mdash;  you gods of Olympus, you still rule on high  if those suitors have truly paid in blood  for all their reckless outrage! Oh, but now  my heart quakes with fear that all the Ithacans  will come down on us in a pack, at any time,  and rush the alarm through every island town!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;There's nothing to fear,&quot; his canny son replied,  &quot;put it from your mind. Let's make for your lodge  beside the orchard here. 1 sent Telemachus on ahead,  the cowherd, swineherd too, to fix a hasty meal.&quot; </p>

<p>So the two went home, confiding all the way,  and arriving at the ample, timbered lodge,  they found Telemachus with the two herdsmen  carving sides of meat and mixing ruddy wine.  Before they ate, the Sicilian serving-woman  bathed her master, Laertes &mdash; his spirits high  in his own room &mdash; and rubbed him down with oil  and round his shoulders drew a fresh new cloak.  And Athena stood beside him, fleshing out the limbs  of the old commander, made him taller to all eyes,  his build more massive, stepping from his bath. </p>

<p></p>

<p>so his own son gazed at him, wonderstruck &mdash;  face-to-face he seemed a deathless god ...  &quot;Father&quot; &mdash; Odysseus' words had wings &mdash; &quot;surely  one of the everlasting gods has made you  taller, stronger, shining in my eyes!&quot; </p>

<p>Facing his son, the wise old man returned,  &quot;If only &mdash; Father Zeus, Athena and lord Apollo &mdash;  1 were the man 1 was, king of the Cephallenians  when 1 sacked the city of Nericus, sturdy fortress  out on its jutting cape! If I'd been young in arms  last night in our house with harness on my back,  standing beside you, fighting off the suitors,  how many 1 would have cut the knees from under &mdash;  the heart inside you would have leapt for joy !&quot; </p>

<p>So father and son confirmed each other's spirits.  And then, with the roasting done, the meal set out,  the others took their seats on chairs and stools,  were just putting their hands to bread and meat  when old Dolius trudged in with his sons,  worn out from the fieldwork.  The old Sicilian had gone and fetched them home,  the mother who reared the boys and tended Dolius well,  now that the years had ground the old man down ...  When they saw Odysseus &mdash; knew him in their bones &mdash;  they stopped in their tracks, staring, struck dumb,  but the king waved them on with a warm and easy air:  &quot;Sit down to your food, old friend. Snap out of your wonder.  We've been cooling our heels here long enough,  eager to get our hands on all this pork,  hoping you'd all troop in at any moment.&quot; </p>

<p>Spreading his arms, Dolius rushed up to him,  clutched Odysseus by the wrist and kissed his hand,  greeting his king now with a burst of winging words:  &quot;Dear master, you're back &mdash; ^the answer to our prayers!  We'd lost all hope, but the gods have brought you home! </p>

<p></p>

<p>Welcome &mdash; health! The skies rain blessings on you!  But tell me the truth now &mdash; this I'd like to know &mdash;  shrewd Penelope, has she heard you're home?  Or should we send a messenger?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;She knows by now,  old man,&quot; his wily master answered brusquely.  &quot;Why busy yourself with that?&quot; </p>

<p>So Dolius went back to his sanded stool.  His sons too, pressing around the famous king,  greeted Odysseus warmly, grasped him by the hand,  then took their seats in order by their father. </p>

<p>But now, as they fell to supper in the lodge.  Rumor the herald sped like wildfire through the city,  crying out the news of the suitors' bloody death and doom,  and massing from every quarter as they listened, kinsmen milled  with wails and moans of grief before Odysseus' palace.  And then they carried out the bodies, every family  buried their own, and the dead from other towns  they loaded onto the rapid ships for crews  to ferry back again, each to his own home ...  Then in a long, mourning file they moved to assembly  where, once they'd grouped, crowding the meeting grounds,  old lord Eupithes rose in their midst to speak out.  Unforgettable sorrow wrung his heart for his son,  Antinous, the first that great Odysseus killed.  In tears for the one he lost, he stood and cried,  &quot;My friends, what a mortal blow this man has dealt  to all our island people! Those fighters, many and brave,  he led away in his curved ships &mdash; he lost the ships  and he lost the men and back he comes again  to kill the best of our Cephallenian princes.  Quick, after him! Before he flees to Pylos  or holy Elis, where Epeans rule in power &mdash;  up, attack! Or we'll hang our heads forever,  all disgraced, even by generations down the years,  if we don't punish the murderers of our brothers and our sons! </p>

<p></p>

<p>why, life would lose its relish &mdash; for me, at least &mdash;  I'd rather die at once and go among the dead.  Attack! &mdash; before the assassins cross the sea  and leave us in their wake.&quot; </p>

<p>He closed in tears  and compassion ran through every Achaean there.  Suddenly Medon and the inspired bard approached them,  fresh from Odysseus' house, where they had just awakened.  They strode into the crowds; amazement took each man  but the herald Medon spoke in all his wisdom:  &quot;Hear me, men of Ithaca. Not without the hand  of the deathless gods did Odysseus do these things!  Myself, 1 saw an immortal fighting at his side &mdash;  like Mentor to the life. 1 saw the same god,  now in front of Odysseus, spurring him on,  now stampeding the suitors through the hall,  crazed with fear, and down they went in droves!&quot; </p>

<p>Terror gripped them all, their faces ashen white.  At last the old warrior Halitherses, Master's son &mdash;  who alone could see the days behind and days ahead &mdash;  rose up and spoke, distraught for each man there:  &quot;Hear me, men of Ithaca. Hear what 1 have to say.  Thanks to your own craven hearts these things were done!  You never listened to me or the good commander Mentor,  you never put a stop to your sons' senseless folly.  What fine work they did, so blind, so reckless,  carving away the wealth, affronting the wife  of a great and famous man, telling themselves  that he'd return no more! So let things rest now.  Listen to me for once &mdash; 1 say don't attack!  Else some will draw the lightning on their necks.&quot; </p>

<p>So he urged </p>

<p>and some held fast to their seats, but more than half  sprang up with warcries now. They had no taste  for the prophet's sane plan &mdash; ^winning Eupithes  quickly won them over. They ran for armor  and once they 'd harnessed up in burnished bronze </p>

<p></p>

<p>they grouped in ranks before the terraced city.  Eupithes led them on in their foolish, mad campaign,  certain he would avenge the slaughter of his son  but the father was not destined to return &mdash;  he'd meet his death in battle then and there. </p>

<p>Athena at this point made appeals to Zeus:  &quot;Father, son of Cronus, our high and mighty king,  now let me ask you a guestion ...  tell me the secrets hidden in your mind.  Will you prolong the pain, the cruel fighting here  or hand down pacts of peace between both sides?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;My child, &quot; Zeus who marshals the thunderheads replied,  &quot;why do you pry and probe me so intently? Come now,  wasn't the plan your own? You conceived it yourself:  Odysseus should return and pay the traitors back.  Do as your heart desires &mdash;  but let me tell you Aowit should be done.  Now that royal Odysseus has taken his revenge,  let both sides seal their pacts that he shall reign for life,  and let us purge their memories of the bloody slaughter  of their brothers and their sons. Let them be friends,  devoted as in the old days. Let peace and wealth  come cresting through the land.&quot; </p>

<p>So Zeus decreed </p>

<p>and launched Athena already poised for action &mdash;  down she swept from Olympus' craggy peaks. </p>

<p>By then Odysseus' men had had their fill  of hearty fare, and the seasoned captain said,  &quot;One of you go outside &mdash; see if they're closing in.&quot;  A son of Dolius snapped to his command,  ran to the door and saw them all too close  and shouted back to Odysseus,  &quot;They're on top of us! To arms &mdash; and fast!&quot;  Up they sprang and strapped themselves in armor,  the three men with Odysseus, Dolius' six sons </p>

<p></p>

<p>and Dolius and Laertes clapped on armor too, </p>

<p>gray as they were, but they would fight if forced. </p>

<p>Once they had all harnessed up in burnished bronze </p>

<p>they opened the doors and strode out, Odysseus in the lead. </p>

<p>And now, taking the build and voice of Mentor,  Zeus's daughter Athena marched right in.  The good soldier Odysseus thrilled to see her,  turned to his son and said in haste, &quot;Telemachus,  you'll learn soon enough &mdash; as you move up to fight  where champions strive to prove themselves the best &mdash;  not to disgrace your father's line a moment.  In battle prowess we've excelled for ages  all across the world.&quot; </p>

<p>Telemachus reassured him,  &quot;Now you'll see, if you care to watch, father,  now I'm fired up. Disgrace, you say?  1 won't disgrace your line!&quot; </p>

<p>Laertes called out in deep delight,  &quot;What a day for me, dear gods! What joy &mdash;  my son and my grandson vying over courage!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Laertes!&quot; </p>

<p>Goddess Athena rushed beside him, eyes ablaze:  &quot;Son of Arcesius, dearest of all my comrades,  say a prayer to the bright-eyed girl and Father Zeus,  then brandish your long spear and wing it fast!&quot; </p>

<p>Athena breathed enormous strength in the old man.  He lifted a prayer to mighty Zeus's daughter,  brandished his spear a moment, winged it fast  and hit Eupithes, pierced his bronze-sided helmet  that failed to block the bronze point tearing through &mdash;  down Eupithes crashed, his armor clanging against his chest.  Odysseus and his gallant son charged straight at the front lines,  slashing away with swords, with two-edged spears and now  they would have killed them all, cut them off from home  if Athena, daughter of storming Zeus, had not cried out </p>

<p></p>

<p>in a piercing voice that stopped all fighters cold,  &quot;Hold back, you men of Ithaca, back from brutal war!  Break off &mdash; shed no more blood &mdash; make peace at once!&quot; </p>

<p>So Athena commanded. Terror blanched their faces,  they went limp with fear, weapons slipped from their hands  and strewed the ground at the goddess' ringing voice.  They spun in flight to the city, wild to save their lives,  but loosing a savage cry, the long-enduring great Odysseus,  gathering all his force, swooped like a soaring eagle &mdash;  just as the son of Cronus hurled a reeking bolt  that fell at her feet, the mighty Father's daughter,  and blazing-eyed Athena wheeled on Odysseus, crying,  &quot;Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, master of exploits,  hold back now! Call a halt to the great leveler. War &mdash;  don't court the rage of Zeus who rules the world!&quot; </p>

<p>So she commanded. He obeyed her, glad at heart.  And Athena handed down her pacts of peace  between both sides for all the years to come &mdash;  the daughter of Zeus whose shield is storm and thunder,  yes, but the goddess still kept Mentor's build and voice. </p>
